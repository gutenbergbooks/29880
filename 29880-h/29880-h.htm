<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em'>FOREWORD</p>
<p>An American ambulance going south stopped on
the snowy road; the driver, an American named
Estridge, got out; his companion, a young
woman in furs, remained in her seat.</p>
<p>Estridge, with the din of the barrage in his ears,
went forward to show his papers to the soldiers who
had stopped him on the snowy forest road.</p>
<p>His papers identified him and the young woman;
and further they revealed the fact that the ambulance
contained only a trunk and some hand luggage; and
called upon all in authority to permit John Henry
Estridge and Miss Palla Dumont to continue without
hindrance the journey therein described.</p>
<p>The soldiers&ndash;&ndash;Siberian riflemen&ndash;&ndash;were satisfied and
seemed friendly enough and rather curious to obtain
a better look at this American girl, Miss Dumont, described
in the papers submitted to them as &ldquo;American
companion to Marie, third daughter of Nicholas
Romanoff, ex-Tzar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An officer came up, examined the papers, shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if authority is to be given this
American lady to join the Romanoff family, now under
detention, it is not my affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he, also, appeared to be perfectly good natured
about the matter, accepting a cigarette from Estridge
and glancing at the young woman in the ambulance
as he lighted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;if it would interest you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xii' name='page_xii'></a>xii</span>
and the young lady, the Battalion of Death is over
yonder in the birch woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s battalion?&rdquo; asked Estridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They make their d&eacute;but to-day. Would you
like to see them? They&rsquo;re going forward in a few
minutes, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge nodded and walked back to the ambulance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s battalion is over in those birch woods,
Miss Dumont. Would you care to walk over and see
them before they leave for the front trenches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl in furs said very gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wish to see women who are about to go into
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from the seat, laid a fur-gloved hand on his
offered arm, and stepped down onto the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To serve,&rdquo; she said, as they started together
through the silver birches, following a trodden way,
&ldquo;is not alone the only happiness in life: it is the only
reason for living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you think so, Miss Dumont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You also must believe so, who are here as a volunteer
in Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little more selfish with me. I&rsquo;m a medical
student; it&rsquo;s a liberal education for me even to drive
an ambulance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one profession nobler than that practised
by the physician, who serves his fellow men,&rdquo;
she said in a low, dreamy voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which profession do you place first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The profession of those who serve God alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priesthood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And the religious orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuns, too?&rdquo; he demanded with the slightest hint
of impatience in his pleasant voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xiii' name='page_xiii'></a>xiii</span></div>
<p>The girl noticed it, looked up at him and smiled
slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had my dear Grand Duchess not asked for me, I
should now he entering upon my novitiate among the
Russian nuns.... And she, too, I think, had there
been no revolution. She was quite ready a year ago.
We talked it over. But the Empress would not permit
it. And then came the trouble about the Deaconesses.
That was a grave mistake&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She checked herself, then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to criticise the Empress, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;such gentle criticism would
seem praise to her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were walking through a pine belt, and in the
shadows of that splendid growth the snow remained
icy, so that they both slipped continually and she took
his arm for security.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I somehow had not thought of you, Miss Dumont,
as so austerely inclined,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She smiled: &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve been a cheerful companion&ndash;&ndash;even
gay? Well, my gaiety made my heart
sing with the prospect of seeing again my dearest
friend&ndash;&ndash;my closest spiritual companion&ndash;&ndash;my darling
little Grand Duchess.... So I have been, naturally
enough, good company on our three days&rsquo; journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled: &ldquo;I never suspected you of such extreme
religious inclinations,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extreme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a novice&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he hesitated. Then, &ldquo;And
you mean, ultimately, to take the black veil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I shall take it some day yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and looked at her, and the man in him
felt the pity of it as do all men when such fresh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xiv' name='page_xiv'></a>xiv</span>
virginal youth as was Miss Dumont&rsquo;s turns an enraptured
face toward that cloister door which never again opens
on those who enter.</p>
<p>Her arm rested warmly and confidently within his;
the cold had made her cheeks very pink and had crisped
the tendrils of her brown hair under the fur toque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; she said happily, &ldquo;you have found in me a
friend, it is because my heart is much too small for all
the love I bear my fellow beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a quaint thing to say,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really true. I care so deeply, so keenly, for
my fellow beings whom God made, that there seemed
only one way to express it&ndash;&ndash;to give myself to God and
pass my life in His service who made these fellow creatures
all around me that I love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is one way of looking
at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to be the only way for me. I came to
it by stages.... And first, as a child, I was impressed
by the loveliness of the world and I used to sit
for hours thinking of the goodness of God. And then
other phases came&ndash;&ndash;socialistic cravings and settlement
work&ndash;&ndash;but you know that was not enough. My heart
was too full to be satisfied. There was not enough
outlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I studied: I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted, what I
needed. I seemed lost; I was obsessed with a desire to
aid&ndash;&ndash;to be of service. I thought that perhaps if I
travelled and studied methods&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked straight ahead of her with a sad little
reflective smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have passed by many strange places in the world....
And then I saw the little Grand Duchess at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xv' name='page_xv'></a>xv</span>
Charity Bazaar.... We seemed to love each other
at first glance.... She asked to have me for her
companion.... They investigated.... And so I
went to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face became sombre and she bent her dark
eyes on the snow as they walked.</p>
<p>All the world was humming and throbbing with the
thunder of the Russian guns. Flakes continually
dropped from vibrating pine trees. A pale yellow
haze veiled the sun.</p>
<p>Suddenly Miss Dumont lifted her head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything ever happens to part me from my
friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I hope I shall die quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you and she so devoted?&rdquo; he asked gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Utterly. And if we can not some day take the
vows together and enter the same order and the same
convent, then the one who is free to do so is so pledged....
I do not think that the Empress will consent to
the Grand Duchess Marie taking the veil.... And
so, when she has no further need of me, I shall make
my novitiate.... There are soldiers ahead, Mr. Estridge.
Is it the woman&rsquo;s battalion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He, also, had caught sight of them. He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Battalion of Death,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what they look like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl-soldiers stood about carelessly, there in the
snow among the silver birches and pines. They looked
like boys in overcoats and boots and tall wool caps,
leaning at ease there on their heavy rifles. Some were
only fifteen years of age. Some had been servants,
some saleswomen, stenographers, telephone operators,
dressmakers, workers in the fields, students at the university,
dancers, laundresses. And a few had been
born into the aristocracy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xvi' name='page_xvi'></a>xvi</span></div>
<p>They came, too, from all parts of the huge, sprawling
Empire, these girl-soldiers of the Battalion of
Death&ndash;&ndash;and there were Cossack girls and gypsies
among them&ndash;&ndash;girls from Finland, Courland, from the
Urals, from Moscow, from Siberia&ndash;&ndash;from North,
South, East, West.</p>
<p>There were Jewesses from the Pale and one Jewess
from America in the ranks; there were Chinese girls,
Poles, a child of fifteen from Trebizond, a Japanese
girl, a French peasant lass; and there were Finns, too,
and Scandinavians&ndash;&ndash;all with clipped hair under the
astrakhan caps&ndash;&ndash;sturdy, well shaped, soldierly girls
who handled their heavy rifles without effort and carried
a regulation equipment as though it were a sheaf
of flowers.</p>
<p>Their commanding officer was a woman of forty.
She lounged in front of the battalion in the snow, consulting
with half a dozen officers of a man&rsquo;s regiment.</p>
<p>The colour guard stood grouped around the battalion
colours, where its white and gold folds swayed languidly
in the breeze, and clots of virgin snow fell upon
it, shaken down from the pines by the cannonade.</p>
<p>Estridge gazed at them in silence. In his man&rsquo;s
mind one thought dominated&ndash;&ndash;the immense pity of it
all. And there was a dreadful fascination in looking
at these girl soldiers, whose soft, warm flesh was so
soon to be mangled by shrapnel and slashed by bayonets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; he muttered at last under his
breath. &ldquo;Was this necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men ran,&rdquo; said Miss Dumont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the filthy boche propaganda that demoralised
them,&rdquo; rejoined Estridge. &ldquo;I wonder&ndash;&ndash;<i>are</i>
women more level headed? Is propaganda wasted on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xvii' name='page_xvii'></a>xvii</span>
these girl soldiers? Are they really superior to the
male of the species?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Miss Dumont softly, &ldquo;that their spiritual
intelligence is deeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They see more clearly, morally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.... I think so sometimes.... We
women, who are born capable of motherhood, seem to
be fashioned also to realise Christ more clearly&ndash;&ndash;and
the holy mother who bore him.... I don&rsquo;t know if
that&rsquo;s the reason&ndash;&ndash;or if, truly, in us a little flame
burns more constantly&ndash;&ndash;the passion which instinctively
flames more brightly toward things of the spirit than of
the flesh.... I think it is true, Mr. Estridge, that,
unless taught otherwise by men, women&rsquo;s inclination
is toward the spiritual, and the ardour of her passion
aspires instinctively to a greater love until the lesser
confuses and perplexes her with its clamorous importunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s love for man you call the lesser love?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, compared to love for God,&rdquo; she said
dreamily.</p>
<p>Some of the girl-soldiers in the Battalion of Death
turned their heads to look at this young girl in furs,
who had come among them on the arm of a Red Cross
driver.</p>
<p>Estridge was aware of many bib brown eyes, many
grey eyes, some blue ones fixed on him and on his companion
in friendly or curious inquiry. They made him
think of the large, innocent eyes of deer or channel
cattle, for there was something both sweet and wild
as well as honest in the gaze of these girl-soldiers.</p>
<p>One, a magnificent blond six-foot creature with the
peaches-and-cream skin of Scandinavia and the clipped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xviii' name='page_xviii'></a>xviii</span>
gold hair of the northland, smiled at Miss Dumont,
displaying a set of superb teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come to see us make our first charge?&rdquo;
she asked in Russian, her sea-blue eyes all a-sparkle.</p>
<p>Miss Dumont said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; very seriously, looking at
the girl&rsquo;s equipment, her blanket roll, gas-mask, boots
and overcoat.</p>
<p>Estridge turned to another girl-soldier:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you are made a prisoner?&rdquo; he enquired in
a low voice. &ldquo;Have you women considered that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nechevo,&rdquo; smiled the girl, who had been a Red
Cross nurse, and who wore two decorations. She
touched the red and black dashes of colour on her
sleeve significantly, then loosened her tunic and drew
out a tiny bag of chamois. &ldquo;We all carry poison,&rdquo;
she said smilingly. &ldquo;We know the boche well enough
to take that precaution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another girl nodded confirmation. They were perfectly
cheerful about it. Several others drew near and
showed their little bags of poison slung around their
necks inside their blouses. Many of them wore holy
relics and medals also.</p>
<p>Miss Dumont took Estridge&rsquo;s arm again and looked
over at the big blond girl-soldier, who also had been
smilingly regarding her, and who now stepped forward
to meet them halfway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you march to the first trenches?&rdquo; asked
Miss Dumont gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the blond goddess, &ldquo;so you are English?&rdquo;
And she added in English: &ldquo;I am Swedish. You have
arrived just in time. I t&rsquo;ink we go forward immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God go with you, for Russia,&rdquo; said Miss Dumont
in a clear, controlled voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xix' name='page_xix'></a>xix</span></div>
<p>But Estridge saw that her dark eyes were suddenly
brilliant with tears. The big blond girl-soldier saw
it, too, and her splendid blue eyes widened. Then,
somehow, she had stepped forward and taken Miss Dumont
in her strong arms; and, holding her, smiled and
gazed intently at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not grieve for us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are
not afraid. We are happy to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Palla Dumont; and took the girl-soldier&rsquo;s
hands in hers. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ilse Westgard. And yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla Dumont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;English? No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! One of our dear Americans! Well, then, you
shall tell your countrymen that you have seen many
women of many lands fighting rifle in hand, so that the
boche shall not strangle freedom in Russia. Will you
tell them, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall return. I, also, shall go to America.
I shall seek for you there, pretty comrade. We shall
become friends. Already I love you very dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed Palla Dumont on both cheeks, holding her
hands tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why you are in Russia, and
where you are now journeying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla looked at her steadily: &ldquo;I am the American
companion to the Grand Duchess Marie; and I am
journeying to the village where the Imperial family is
detained, because she has obtained permission for me
to rejoin her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a short silence; the blue eyes of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xx' name='page_xx'></a>xx</span>
Swedish girl had become frosty as two midwinter stars.
Suddenly they glimmered warm again as twin violets:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kharasho!&rdquo; she said smiling. &ldquo;And do you love
your little comrade duchess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next only to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very beautiful, Palla. She is a child to
be enlightened. Teach her the greater truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has learned it, Ilse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And, if God wills it, she, and I also, take the
vows some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The veil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! A nun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If God accepts me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Swedish girl-soldier stood gazing upon her as
though fascinated, crushing Palla&rsquo;s slim hands between
her own.</p>
<p>Presently she shook her head with a wearied smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is one thing I can not understand&ndash;&ndash;the
veil. No. I can understand <i>this</i>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; turning
her head and glancing proudly around her at her
girl comrades. &ldquo;I can comprehend this thing that I
am doing. But not what you wish to do, Palla. Not
such service as you offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to serve the source of all good. My heart
is too full to be satisfied by serving mankind alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl-soldier shook her head: &ldquo;I try to understand.
I can not. I am sorry, because I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, Ilse. I love my fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to the imperial family?&rdquo; demanded Ilse
abruptly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxi' name='page_xxi'></a>xxi</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to see you again. I shall try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battalion marched a few moments later.</p>
<p>It was rather a bad business. They went over the
top with a cheer. Fifty answered roll call that night.</p>
<p>However, the hun had learned one thing&ndash;&ndash;that
women soldiers were inferior to none.</p>
<p>Russia learned it, too. Everywhere battalions were
raised, uniformed, armed, equipped, drilled. In the
streets of cities the girl-soldiers became familiar
sights: nobody any longer turned to stare at them.
There were several dozen girls in the officers&rsquo; school,
trying for commissions. In all the larger cities there
were infantry battalions of girls, Cossack troops, machine
gun units, signallers; they had a medical corps
and transport service.</p>
<p>But never but once again did they go into action.
And their last stand was made facing their own people,
the brain-crazed Reds.</p>
<p>And after that the Battalion of Death became only
a name; and the girl-soldiers bewildered fugitives,
hunted down by the traitors who had sold out to the
Germans at Brest-Litovsk.

<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em'>PREFACE</p>
<p>A door opened; the rush of foggy air set the
flames of the altar candles blowing wildly.
There came the clank of armed men.</p>
<p>Then, in the dim light of the chapel, a novice sprang
to her feet, brushing the white veil from her pallid
young face.</p>
<p>At that the ex-Empress, still kneeling, lifted her
head from her devotions and calmly turned it, looking
around over her right shoulder.</p>
<p>The file of Red infantry advanced, shuffling slowly
forward as though feeling their way through the candle-lit
dusk across the stone floor. Their accoutrements
clattered and clinked in the intense stillness. A
slovenly officer, switching a thin, naked sword in his
ungloved fist, led them. Another officer, carrying a
sabre and marching in the rear, halted to slam and
lock the heavy chapel door; then he ran forward to
rejoin his men, while the chapel still reverberated with
the echoes of the clanging door.</p>
<p>A chair or two fell, pushed aside by the leading soldiers
and hastily kicked out of the way as the others
advanced more swiftly now. For there seemed to be
some haste. These men were plainly in a hurry, whatever
their business there might be.</p>
<p>The Tzesarevitch, kneeling beside his mother, got
up from his knees with visible difficulty. The Empress
also rose, leisurely, supporting herself by one hand
resting on the prie-dieu.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxiv' name='page_xxiv'></a>xxiv</span></div>
<p>Then several young girls, who had been kneeling behind
her at their devotions, stood up and turned to
stare at the oncoming armed men, now surrounding
them.</p>
<p>The officer carrying the naked sword, and reeking
with fumes of brandy, counted these women in a
loud, thick voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all present&ndash;&ndash;one!
two! three! four! five! six!&ndash;&ndash;the whole accursed brood!&rdquo;
pointing waveringly with his sword from one to another.</p>
<p>Then he laughed stupidly, leering out of his inflamed
eyes at the five women who all wore the garbs of the
Sisters of Mercy, their white coiffes and tabliers contrasting
sharply with the sombre habits of the Russian
nuns who had gathered in the candle-lit dusk behind
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; demanded the ex-Empress in a
fairly steady voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer to your names!&rdquo; retorted the officer brutally.
The other officer came up and began to fumble
for a note book in the breast of his dirty tunic. When
he found it he licked the lead of his pencil and squinted
at the ex-Empress out of drunken eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexandra Feodorovna!&rdquo; he barked in her face.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re here, say so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remained calm, mute, cold as ice.</p>
<p>A soldier behind her suddenly began to shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the German woman. That&rsquo;s the friend of
the Staretz Novykh! That&rsquo;s Sascha! Now we&rsquo;ve got
her, the thing to do is to shoot her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark her present,&rdquo; interrupted the officer in command.
&ldquo;No ceremony, now. Mark the cub Romanoff
present. Mark &rsquo;em all&ndash;&ndash;Olga, Tatyana, Marie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxv' name='page_xxv'></a>xxv</span>
Anastasia!&ndash;&ndash;no matter which is which&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;re all Romanoffs&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the same soldier who had interrupted before
bawled out again: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not Romanoffs! There
are no German Romanoffs. There are no Romanoffs
in Russia since a hundred and fifty years&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Tzesarevitch, Alexis, red with anger,
stepped forward to confront the man, his frail hands
fiercely clenched. The officer in command struck him
brutally across the breast with the flat of his sword,
shoved him aside, strode toward the low door of the
chapel crypt and jerked it open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Line them up!&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll settle this Romanoff
dispute once for all! Shove them into line!
Hurry up, there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there seemed to be some confusion between the
nuns and the soldiers, as the latter attempted to separate
the ex-Empress and the young Grand Duchesses
from the sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that trouble about!&rdquo; cried the officer
commanding. &ldquo;Drive back those nuns, I tell you!
They&rsquo;re Germans, too! They&rsquo;re Sascha&rsquo;s new Deaconesses!
Kick &rsquo;em out of the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the novice, who had cried out in fear when the
Red infantry first entered the chapel, forced her way
out into the file formed by the Empress and her daughters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a frightful mistake!&rdquo; she cried, laying one
hand on the arm of a young girl dressed, like the others,
as a Sister of Mercy. &ldquo;This woman is Miss Dumont,
my American companion! Release her! <b>I</b> am
the Grand Duchess Marie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, whose arm had been seized, looked at the
young novice over her shoulder in a dazed way; then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxvi' name='page_xxvi'></a>xxvi</span>
suddenly her lovely face flushed scarlet; tears sprang
to her eyes; and she said to the infuriated officer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true, Captain! I am the Grand Duchess
Marie. She is trying to save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil is all this row!&rdquo; roared the officer,
who now came tramping and storming among the prisoners,
switching his sword to and fro with ferocious
impatience.</p>
<p>The little Sister of Mercy, frightened but resolute,
pointed at the novice, who still clutched her by the
arm: &ldquo;It is not true what she tells you,&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;I am the Grand Duchess Marie, and this novice is my
American companion, Miss Dumont, who loves me devotedly
and who now attempts to sacrifice herself in
my place&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> the Grand Duchess Marie!&rdquo; interrupted the
novice excitedly. &ldquo;This young girl dressed like a Sister
of Mercy is only my American companion&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; yelled the officer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you
both, then!&rdquo; But the girl in the Sister of Mercy&rsquo;s
garb turned and violently pushed the novice from her
so that she stumbled and fell on her knees among the
nuns.</p>
<p>Then, confronting the officer: &ldquo;You Bolshevik
dog,&rdquo; she said contemptuously, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you even know
the daughter of your dead Emperor when you see
her!&rdquo; And she struck him across the face with her
prayer book.</p>
<p>As he recoiled from the blow a soldier shouted:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your proof! There&rsquo;s your insolent Romanoff
for you! To hell with the whole litter! Shoot them!&rdquo;
Instantly a savage roar from the Reds filled that dim
place; a soldier violently pushed the young Tzesarevitch
into the file behind the Empress and held him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxvii' name='page_xxvii'></a>xxvii</span>
there; the Grand Duchess Olga was flung bodily after
him; the other children, in their hospital dresses, were
shoved brutally toward their places, menaced by butt
and bayonet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;March!&rdquo; bawled the officer in command.</p>
<p>But now, among the dark-garbed nuns, a slender
white figure was struggling frantically to free herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You red dogs!&rdquo; she cried in an agonised voice.
&ldquo;Let that English woman go! It is I you want! Do
you hear! I mock at you! I mock at your resolution!
Boje Tzaria Khrani! Down with the Bolsheviki!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A soldier turned and fired at her; the bullet smashed
an ikon above her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Grand Duchess Marie!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I
demand my place! I demand my fate! Let that
American girl go! Do you hear what I say? Red
beasts! Red beasts! I am the Grand Duchess!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer who closed the file turned savagely and
shook his heavy cavalry sabre at her: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back
in a moment and cut your throat for you!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>Then, in the file, and just as the last bayonets were
vanishing through the crypt door, one of the young
girls turned and kissed her hand to the sobbing novice&ndash;&ndash;a
pretty gesture, tender, gay, not tragic, even almost
mischievously triumphant.</p>
<p>It was the adieu of the Grand Duchess Tatyana to
the living world&ndash;&ndash;her last glimpse of it through the
flames of the altar candles gilding the dead Christ on
his jewelled cross&ndash;&ndash;the image of that Christ she was
so soon to gaze upon when those lovely, mischievous
young eyes of hers unclosed in Paradise....</p>
<p>The door of the crypt slammed. A terrible silence
reigned in the chapel.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxviii' name='page_xxviii'></a>xxviii</span></div>
<p>Then the novice uttered a cry, caught the foot of
the cross with desperate hands, hung there convulsively.</p>
<p>To her the Mother Superior turned, weeping. But
at her touch the girl, crazed with grief, lifted both
hands and tore from her own face the veil of her novitiate
just begun;&ndash;&ndash;tore her white garments from
her shoulders, crying out in a strangled voice that if a
Christian God let such things happen then He was no
God of hers&ndash;&ndash;that she would never enter His service&ndash;&ndash;that
the Lord Christ was no bridegroom for her;
and, her novitiate was ended&ndash;&ndash;ended together with
every vow of chastity, of humility, of poverty, of even
common humanity which she had ever hoped to take.</p>
<p>The girl was now utterly beside herself; at one moment
flaming and storming with fury among the terrified,
huddling nuns; the next instant weeping, stamping
her felt-shod foot in ungovernable revolt at this
horror which any God in any heaven could permit.</p>
<p>And again and again she called out on Christ to
stop this thing and prove Himself a real God to a pagan
world that mocked Him.</p>
<p>Dishevelled, her rent veil in tatters on her naked
shoulders, she sprang across the chapel to the crypt
door, shook it, tore at it, seized chair after chair and
shattered them to splinters against the solid panels
of oak and iron.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly motionless, she crouched and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother of God!&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;intervene now&ndash;&ndash;<i>now</i>!&ndash;&ndash;or
never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The muffled rattle of a rather ragged volley answered
her prayer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxix' name='page_xxix'></a>xxix</span></div>
<p>Outside the convent a sentry&ndash;&ndash;a Kronstadt sailor&ndash;&ndash;stood.
He also heard the underground racket. He
nodded contentedly to himself. Other shots followed&ndash;&ndash;pistol
shots&ndash;&ndash;singly.</p>
<p>After a few moments a wisp of smoke from the crypt
crept lazily out of the low oubliettes. The day was
grey and misty; rain threatened; and the rifle smoke
clung low to the withered grass, scarcely lifting.</p>
<p>The sentry lighted a third cigarette, one eye on the
barred oubliettes, from which the smoke crawled and
spread out over the grass.</p>
<p>After a while a sweating face appeared behind the
bars and a half-stifled voice demanded why there was
any delay about fetching quick-lime. And, still clinging
to the bars with bloody fingers, he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a damned novice in the chapel. I promised
to cut her throat for her. Go in and get her and
bring her down here.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The novice was nowhere to be found.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>They searched the convent thoroughly; they went
out into the garden and beat the shrubbery, kicking
through bushes and saplings, their cocked rifles poised
for a snap shot.</p>
<p>Peasants, gathering there more thickly now, watched
them stupidly; the throng increased in the convent
grounds. Some Bolshevik soldiers pushed through the
rapidly growing crowd and ran toward a birch wood
east of the convent. Beyond the silvery fringe of
birches, larger trees of a heavy, hard-wood forest
loomed. Among these splendid trees a number of
beeches were being felled on both sides of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see a White Nun run this way?&rdquo; demanded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxx' name='page_xxx'></a>xxx</span>
the soldiers of the wood-cutters. The latter shook
their heads:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing has passed,&rdquo; they said seriously, &ldquo;except
some Ural Cossacks riding north like lost souls in a
hurricane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An officer of the Red battalion, who had now hastened
up with pistol swinging, flew into a frightful
rage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cossacks!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;You cowardly dogs,
what do you mean by letting Kaledines&rsquo; horsemen gallop
over you like that&ndash;&ndash;you with your saws and axes&ndash;&ndash;twenty
lusty comrades to block the road and pull the
Imperialists off their horses! Shame! For all I know
you&rsquo;ve let a Romanoff escape alive into the world!
That&rsquo;s probably what you&rsquo;ve done, you greasy louts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wood-cutters gaped stupidly; the Bolshevik officer
cursed them again and gesticulated with his pistol.
Other soldiers of the Red battalion ran up. One
nudged the officer&rsquo;s elbow without saluting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That other prisoner can&rsquo;t be found&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! That Swedish girl!&rdquo; yelled the officer.</p>
<p>Several soldiers began speaking excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were in the cellar, they say she ran
away&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain, while we were about that business in
the crypt, Kaledines&rsquo; horsemen rode up outside&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who saw them?&rdquo; demanded the officer hoarsely.
&ldquo;God curse you, who saw them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some peasants had now come up. One of them
began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your <i>honour</i>, I saw Prince Kaledines&rsquo; riders&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whose!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hetman&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your <i>honour</i>! <i>Prince</i> Kaledines! The Hetman!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxi' name='page_xxxi'></a>xxxi</span>
Damnation! Who do you think you are! Who do
you think I am!&rdquo; burst out the Red officer in a fury.
&ldquo;Get out of my way!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He pushed the peasants
right and left and strode away toward the convent.
His soldiers began to straggle after him. One of them
winked at the wood-cutters with his tongue in his cheek,
and slung the rifle he carried over his right shoulder
<i>en bandouli&egrave;re</i>, muzzle downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tavarish is in a temper,&rdquo; he said with a jerk
of his thumb toward the officer. &ldquo;We arrested that
Swedish girl in the uniform of the woman&rsquo;s battalion.
One shoots that breed on sight, you know. But we
were in such a hurry to finish with the Romanoffs&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
He shrugged: &ldquo;You see, comrades, we should have
taken her into the crypt and shot her along with the
Romanoffs. That&rsquo;s how one loses these birds&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;re
off if you turn your back to light a cigarette in the
wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the wood-cutters said: &ldquo;Among Kaledines&rsquo;
horsemen were two women. One was crop-headed like
a boy, and half naked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A White Nun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows. She had some white rags hanging to
her body, and dark hair clipped like a boy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&ndash;&ndash;was&ndash;&ndash;she!&rdquo; said the soldier with slow conviction.
He turned and looked down the long perspective
of the forest road. Only a raven stalked
there all alone over the fallen leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that was our White Nun.
The Cossacks took her with them. They must have
ridden fast, the horsemen of Kaledines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a swift storm. Like the souls of the damned,&rdquo;
replied a peasant.</p>
<p>The soldier shrugged: &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s still a Romanoff
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxii' name='page_xxxii'></a>xxxii</span>
loose in the world, God save the world!... And that
big heifer of a Swedish wench!&ndash;&ndash;she was a bad one,
I tell you!&ndash;&ndash;Took six of us to catch her and ten to
hold her by her ten fingers and toes! Hey! God
bless me, but she stands six feet and is made of steel
cased in silk&ndash;&ndash;all white, smooth and iron-hard&ndash;&ndash;the
blond young snow-tiger that she is!&ndash;&ndash;the yellow-haired,
six-foot, slippery beastess! God bless me&ndash;&ndash;God bless
me!&rdquo; he muttered, staring down the wood-road to its
vanishing point against the grey horizon.</p>
<p>Then he hitched his slung rifle to a more comfortable
position, turned, gazed at the convent across the
fields, which his distant comrades were now approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A German nest,&rdquo; he said aloud to himself, &ldquo;full of
their damned Deaconesses! Hey! I&rsquo;ll be going along
to see what&rsquo;s to be done with them, also!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded to the wood-cutters:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vermin-killing time,&rdquo; he remarked cheerily. &ldquo;After
the dirty work is done, peace, land enough for everybody,
ease and plenty and a full glass always at one&rsquo;s
elbows&ndash;&ndash;eh, comrades?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode away across the fields.</p>
<p>It had begun to snow.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>They were from the Urals: they sat their shaggy
little grey horses, lance in hand, stirrup deep in saddle
paraphernalia&ndash;&ndash;kit-bags, tents, blankets, trusses of
straw, a dead fowl or two or a quarter of beef. And
from every saddle dangled a balalaika and the terrible
Cossack whip.</p>
<p>The steel of their lances flashed red in the setting
sun; snow whirled before the wind in blinding pinkish
clouds, powdering horse and rider from head to heel.</p>
<p>Again one rider unslung his balalaika, struck it,
looking skyward as he rode:</p>

<i>Nichevo! Stoi!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>They rode into a forest, slowly, filing among the
silver birches, then trotting out amid the pines.</p>
<p>The Swedish girl towered in her saddle, dwarfing
the shaggy pony. She wore her grey wool cap, overcoat,
and boots. Pistols bulged in the saddle holsters;
sacks of grain and a bag of camp tins lay across pommel
and cantle.</p>
<p>Beside her rode the novice, swathed to the eyes in a
sheepskin greatcoat, and a fur cap sheltering her
shorn head.</p>
<p>Her lethargy&ndash;&ndash;a week&rsquo;s reaction from the horrors of
the convent&ndash;&ndash;had vanished; and a feverish, restless
alertness had taken its place.</p>
<p>Nothing of the still, white novice was visible now in
her brilliant eyes and flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>Her tragic silence had given place to an unnatural
loquacity; her grief to easily aroused mirth; and the
dark sorrow in her haunted eyes was gone, and they
grew brown and sunny and vivacious.</p>
<p>She talked freely with her comrade, Ilse Westgard;
she exchanged gossip and banter with the Cossacks,
argued with them, laughed with them, sang with them.</p>
<p>At night she slept in her sheepskin in Ilse Westgard&rsquo;s
vigorous arms; morning, noon and evening she
filled the samovar with snow beside Cossack fires, or
in the rare cantonments afforded in wretched villages,
where whiskered and filthy mujiks cringed to the Cossacks,
whispering to one another: &ldquo;There is no end
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxv' name='page_xxxv'></a>xxxv</span>
to death; there is no end to the fighting and the dying,
God bless us all. There is no end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the glare of great fires in muddy streets she
stood, swathed in her greatcoat, her cap pushed back,
looking like some beautiful, impudent boy, while the
Cossacks sang &ldquo;Lada oy Lada!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and let their slanting
eyes wander sideways toward her, till her frank
laughter set the singers grinning and the <i>gusli</i> was
laid aside.</p>
<p>And once, after a swift gallop to cross a railroad
and an exchange of shots with the Red guards at long
range, the sotnia of the Wild Division rode at evening
into a little hamlet of one short, miserable street, and
shouted for a fire that could be seen as far as Moscow.</p>
<p>That night they discovered vodka&ndash;&ndash;not much&ndash;&ndash;enough
to set them singing first, then dancing. The
troopers danced together in the fire-glare&ndash;&ndash;clumsily,
in their boots, with interims of the <i>pas seul</i> savouring
of the capers of those ancient Mongol horsemen in the
<i>Hezars</i> of Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>But no dancing, no singing, no clumsy capers were
enough to satisfy these riders of the Wild Division,
now made boisterous by vodka and horse-meat. Gossip
crackled in every group; jests flew; they shouted
at the peasants; they roared at their own jokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comrade novice!&ndash;&ndash;Pretty boy with a shorn head!&rdquo;
they bawled. &ldquo;Harangue us once more on law and
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood with legs apart and thumbs hooked in her
belt, laughing at them across the fire. And all around
crowded the wretched <i>mujiks</i>, peering at her through
shaggy hair, out of little wolfish eyes.</p>
<p>A Cossack shouted: &ldquo;My law first! Land for all!
That is what we have, we Cossacks! Land for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxvi' name='page_xxxvi'></a>xxxvi</span>
people, one and all&ndash;&ndash;land for the <i>mujik</i>; land for the
bourgeois; land for the aristocrat! That law solves
all, clears all questions, satisfies all. It is the Law
of Peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Cossack shoved a soldier-deserter forward into
the firelight. He wore a patch of red on his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer, comrade! Is that the true law? Or have
you and your comrades made a better one in Petrograd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deserter, a little frightened, tried to grin: &ldquo;A
good law is, kill all generals,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;Afterward
we shall have peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A roar of laughter greeted him; these dark, thickset
Cossacks with slanting eyes were from the Urals.
What did they care how many generals were killed?
Besides, their hetman had already killed himself.</p>
<p>Their officer moved out into the firelight&ndash;&ndash;a reckless
rider but a dull brain&ndash;&ndash;and stood lashing at his
snow-crusted boots with the silver-mounted quirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like gendarmes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we Cossacks are forever
doing the dirty work of other people. Why? It
begins to sicken me. Why are we forever executing
the law! What law? Who made it? The Tzar. And
he is dead, and what is the good of the law he made?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should free Cossacks be policemen any more
when there is no law?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We played gendarme for the Monarchists. We
answered the distress call of the Cadets and the bourgeoisie!
Where are they? Where is the law they
made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood switching his dirty boots and swinging
his heavy head right and left with the stupid, lowering
menace of a bull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then came the Mensheviki with their law,&rdquo; he bellowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxvii' name='page_xxxvii'></a>xxxvii</span>
suddenly. &ldquo;Again we became policemen, galloping
to their whistle. Where are they? Where is
their law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spat on the snow, twirled his quirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one law to govern the land,&rdquo; he
roared. &ldquo;It is the law of hands off and mind your
business! It&rsquo;s a good law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good law for those who already have something,&rdquo;
cried a high, thin voice from the throng of peasants.</p>
<p>The Cossacks, who all possessed their portion of
land, yelled with laughter. One of them called out to
the Swedish girl for her opinion, and the fair young
giantess strode gracefully out into the fire-ring, her
cap in her hand and the thick blond ringlets shining
like gold on her beautiful head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Listen to this soldier of the Death Battalion!&rdquo;
shouted the Cossacks in great glee. &ldquo;She
will tell us what the law should be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed: &ldquo;We fought for it&ndash;&ndash;we women soldiers,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;And the law we fought for was
made when the first tyrant fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the law: Freedom of mind; liberty of choice;
an equal chance for all; no violence; only orderly debate
to determine the will of the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Cossack said loudly: &ldquo;<i>Da volna!</i> Those who
have nothing would take, then, from those who have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not!&rdquo; cried another,&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;not in the Urals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thunderous laughter from their comrades and cries
of, &ldquo;Palla! Let us hear our pretty boy, who has made
for the whole world a law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla Dumont, her slender hands thrust deep in her
great coat sleeves, and standing like a nun lost in
mystic revery, looked up with gay audacity&ndash;&ndash;not like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxviii' name='page_xxxviii'></a>xxxviii</span>
a nun at all, now, save for the virginal allure that
seemed a part of the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one law, Tavarishi,&rdquo; she said, turning
slightly from her hips as she spoke, to include those behind
her in the circle: &ldquo;and that law was not made
by man. That law was born, already made, when the
first man was born. It has never changed. It comprehends
everything; includes everything and everybody;
it solves all perplexity, clears all doubts, decides
all questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a living law; it exists; it is the key to every
problem; and it is all ready for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face had altered; the half mischievous
audacity in defiance of her situation&ndash;&ndash;the gay, impudent
confidence in herself and in these wild comrades
of hers, had given place to something more serious,
more ardent&ndash;&ndash;the youthful intensity that smiles
through the flaming enchantment of suddenly discovered
knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the oldest of all laws,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was born
perfect. It is yours if you accept it. And this law
is the Law of Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A peasant muttered: &ldquo;One gives where one loves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned swiftly: &ldquo;That is the soul of the
Law!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;to give! Is there any other happiness,
Tavarishi? Is there any other peace? Is
there need of any other law?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you that the Law of Love slays greed! And
when greed dies, war dies. And hunger, and misery
die, too!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what use is any government and its lesser laws
and customs, unless it is itself governed by that paramount
Law?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what avail are your religions, your churches,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxix' name='page_xxxix'></a>xxxix</span>
your priests, your saints, relics, ikons&ndash;&ndash;all your candles
and observances&ndash;&ndash;unless dominated by that Law?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what use is your God unless that Law of Love
also governs Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood gazing at the firelit faces, the virginal
half-smile on her lips.</p>
<p>A peasant broke the silence: &ldquo;Is she a new saint,
then?&rdquo; he said distinctly.</p>
<p>A Cossack nodded to her, grinning respectfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always like your sermons, little novice,&rdquo; he
said. And, to the others: &ldquo;Nobody wishes to deny
what she says is quite true&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he scratched his head,
still grinning&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;only&ndash;&ndash;while there are Kurds in the
world&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bolsheviki!&rdquo; shouted another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True! And Turks! God bless us, Tavarishi,&rdquo; he
added with a wry face, &ldquo;it takes a stronger stomach
to love these beasts than is mine&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the sudden shout of laughter the girl, Palla,
looked around at her comrade, Ilse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until each accepts the Law of Love,&rdquo; said the
Swedish girl-soldier, laughing, &ldquo;it can not be a law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have accepted it,&rdquo; said Palla gaily; but her childishly
lovely mouth was working, and she clenched her
hands in her sleeves to control the tremor.</p>
<p>Silent, the smile still stamped on her tremulous lips,
she stood for a few moments, fighting back the deep
emotions enveloping her in surging fire&ndash;&ndash;the same
ardent and mystic emotions which once had consumed
her at the altar&rsquo;s foot, where she had knelt, a novice,
dreaming of beatitudes ineffable.</p>
<p>If that vision, for her, was ended&ndash;&ndash;its substance but
the shadow of a dream&ndash;&ndash;the passion that created it,
the fire that purified it, the ardent heart that needed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xl' name='page_xl'></a>xl</span>
love&ndash;&ndash;love sacred, love unalloyed&ndash;&ndash;needed love still,
burned for it, yearning to give.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>As she lifted her head and looked around her with
dark eyes still a little dazed, there was a sudden commotion
among the <i>mujiks</i>; a Cossack called out something
in a sharp voice; their officer walked hastily out
into the darkness; a shadowy rider spurred ahead of
him.</p>
<p>Suddenly a far voice shouted: &ldquo;Who goes there!
<i>Stoi!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then red flashes came out of the night; Cossacks ran
for their horses; Ilse appeared with Palla&rsquo;s pony as
well as her own, and halted to listen, the fearless smile
playing over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mount!&rdquo; cried many voices at once. &ldquo;The Reds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla flung herself astride her saddle; Ilse galloped
beside her, freeing her pistols; everywhere in the starlight
the riders of the Wild Division came galloping,
loosening their long lances as they checked their horses
in close formation.</p>
<p>Then, with scarcely a sound in the unbroken snow,
they filed away eastward at a gentle trot, under the
pale lustre of the stars.

<h1>THE CRIMSON TIDE</h1>
<div class='chsp' style='padding-top:0'>
<a name='CHAPTER_I' id='CHAPTER_I'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>On the 7th of November, 1917, the Premier of
the Russian Revolutionary Government was a
hunted fugitive, his ministers in prison, his
troops scattered or dead. Three weeks later, the irresponsible
Reds had begun their shameful career of
treachery, counselled by a pallid, black-eyed man with
a muzzle like a mouse&ndash;&ndash;one L. D. Bronstein, called
Trotzky; and by two others&ndash;&ndash;one a bald, smooth-shaven,
rotund little man with an expression that made
men hesitate, and features not trusted by animals and
children.</p>
<p>The Red Parliament called him Vladimir Ulianov,
and that&rsquo;s what he called himself. He had proved to
be reticent, secretive, deceitful, diligent, and utterly
unhuman. His lower lip was shaped as though something
dripped from it. Blood, perhaps. His eyes
were brown and not entirely unattractive. But God
makes the eyes; the mouth is fashioned by one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>The world knew him as Lenine.</p>
<p>The third man squinted. He wore a patch of sparse
cat-hairs on his chin and upper lip.</p>
<p>His head was too big; his legs too short, but they
were always in a hurry, always in motion. He had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
persuasive and ardent tongue, and practically no
mind. The few ideas he possessed inclined him to violence&ndash;&ndash;always
the substitute for reason in this sort of
agitator. It was this ever latent violence that proved
persuasive. His name was Krylenko. His smile was
a grin.</p>
<p>These three men betrayed Christ on March 3d, 1918.</p>
<p>On the Finland Road, outside of Petrograd, the
Red ragamuffins held a perpetual carmagnole, and all
fugitives danced to their piping, and many paid for
the music.</p>
<p>But though White Guards and Red now operated in
respectively hostile gangs everywhere throughout the
land, and the treacherous hun armies were now in full
tide of their Baltic invasion, there still remained ways
and means of escape&ndash;&ndash;inconspicuous highways and unguarded
roads still open that led out of that white
hell to the icy but friendly seas clashing against the
northward coasts.</p>
<p>Diplomats were inelegantly &ldquo;beating it.&rdquo; A kindly
but futile Ambassador shook the snow of Petrograd
from his galoshes and solemnly and laboriously vanished.
Mixed bands of attach&eacute;s, consular personnel,
casuals, emissaries, newspaper men, and mission specialists
scattered into unfeigned flight toward those
several and distant sections of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Country,&rdquo; divided
among civilised nations and lying far away somewhere
in the outer sunshine.</p>
<p>Sometimes White Guards caught these fugitives;
sometimes Red Guards; and sometimes the hun nabbed
them on the general hunnish principle that whatever
is running away is fair game for a pot shot.</p>
<p>Even the American Red Cross was &ldquo;suspect&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;treachery
being alleged in its relations with Roumania;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
and hun and Bolshevik became very troublesome&ndash;&ndash;so
troublesome, in fact, that Estridge, for example, was
having an impossible time of it, arrested every few
days, wriggling out of it, only to be collared again and
detained.</p>
<p>Sometimes they questioned him concerning gun-running
into Roumania; sometimes in regard to his part
in conducting the American girl, Miss Dumont, to the
convent where the imperial family had been detained.</p>
<p>That the de facto government had requested him to
undertake this mission and to employ an American
Red Cross ambulance in the affair seemed to make no
difference.</p>
<p>He continued to be dogged, spied on, arrested, detained,
badgered, until one evening, leaving the Smolny,
he encountered an American&ndash;&ndash;a slim, short man who
smiled amiably upon him through his glasses, removed
a cigar from his lips, and asked Estridge what was the
nature of his evident and visible trouble.</p>
<p>So they walked back to the hotel together and settled
on a course of action during the long walk. What
this friend in need did and how he did it, Estridge
never learned; but that same evening he was instructed
to pack up, take a train, and descend at a certain
station a few hours later.</p>
<p>Estridge followed instructions, encountered no interference,
got off at the station designated, and
waited there all day, drinking boiling tea.</p>
<p>Toward evening a train from Petrograd stopped at
the station, and from the open door of a compartment
Estridge saw his chance acquaintance of the previous
day making signs to him to get aboard.</p>
<p>Nobody interfered. They had a long, cold, unpleasant
night journey, wedged in between two soldiers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
wearing arm-bands, who glowered at a Russian
general officer opposite, and continued to mutter to
each other about imperialists, bourgeoisie, and cadets.</p>
<p>At every stop they were inspected by lantern light,
their papers examined, and sometimes their luggage
opened. But these examinations seemed to be perfunctory,
and nobody was detained.</p>
<p>In the grey of morning the train stopped and some
soldiers with red arm-bands looked in and insulted the
general officer, but offered no violence. The officer
gave them a stony glance and closed his cold, puffy
eyes in disdain. He was blond and looked like a German.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At the next stop Estridge received a careless nod
from his chance acquaintance, gathered up his luggage
and descended to the frosty platform.</p>
<p>Nobody bothered to open their bags; their papers
were merely glanced at. They had some steaming tea
and some sour bread together.</p>
<p>A little later a large sleigh drove up behind the station;
their light baggage was stowed aboard, they
climbed in under the furs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; remarked his calm companion to Estridge,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re all right if the Reds, the Whites and the boches
don&rsquo;t shoot us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the chances?&rdquo; inquired Estridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent, excellent,&rdquo; said his companion cheerily,
&ldquo;I should say we have about one chance in ten to get
out of this alive. I&rsquo;ll take either end&ndash;&ndash;ten to one
we don&rsquo;t get out&ndash;&ndash;ten to two we&rsquo;re shot up and not
killed&ndash;&ndash;ten to three we are arrested but not killed&ndash;&ndash;one
to ten we pull through with whole skins.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>Estridge smiled. They remained silent, probably
preoccupied with the hazards of their respective fortunes.
It grew colder toward noon.</p>
<p>The young man seated beside Estridge in the sleigh
smoked continually.</p>
<p>He was attached to one of the American missions
sent into Russia by an optimistic administration&ndash;&ndash;a
mission, as a whole, foredoomed to political failure.</p>
<p>In every detail, too, it had already failed, excepting
only in that particular part played by this young man,
whose name was Brisson.</p>
<p>He, however, had gone about his occult business in
a most amazing manner&ndash;&ndash;the manner of a Yankee who
knows what he wants and what his country ought to
want if it knew enough to know it wanted it.</p>
<p>He was the last American to leave Petrograd: he
had taken his time; he left only when he was quite ready
to leave.</p>
<p>And this was the man, now seated beside Estridge,
who had coolly and cleverly taken his sporting chance
in remaining till the eleventh hour and the fifty-ninth
minute in the service of his country. Then, as the
twelfth hour began to strike, he bluffed his way
through.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>During the first two or three days of sleigh travel,
Brisson learned all he desired to know about Estridge,
and Estridge learned almost nothing about Brisson
except that he possessed a most unholy genius for
wriggling out of trouble.</p>
<p>Nothing, nobody, seemed able to block this young
man&rsquo;s progress. He bluffed his way through White
Guards and Red; he squirmed affably out of the
clutches of wandering Cossacks; he jollied officials of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
all shades of political opinion; but he always continued
his journey from one &eacute;tape to the next. Also, he
was continually lighting one large cigar after another.
Buttoned snugly into his New York-made arctic clothing,
and far more comfortable at thirty below zero than
was Estridge in Russian costume, he smoked comfortably
in the teeth of the icy gale or conversed soundly
on any topic chosen. And the range was wide.</p>
<p>But about himself and his mission in Russia he never
conversed except to remark, once, that he could buy
better Russian clothing in New York than in Petrograd.</p>
<p>Indeed, his only concession to the customs of the
country was in the fur cap he wore. But it was the
galoshes of Manhattan that saved his feet from freezing.
He had two pair and gave one to Estridge.</p>
<p>During several hundreds of miles in sleighs, Brisson&rsquo;s
constant regret was the absence of ferocious
wolves. He desired to enjoy the whole show as depicted
by the geographies. He complained to Estridge
quite seriously concerning the lack of enterprise
among the wolves.</p>
<p>But there seemed to be no wolves in Russia sufficiently
polite to oblige him; so he comforted himself
by patting his stomach where, sewed inside his outer
underclothing, reposed documents destined to electrify
the civilised world with proof infernal of the treachery
of those three men who belong in history and in
hell to the fraternity which includes Benedict Arnold
and Judas.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>One late afternoon, while smoking his large cigar
and hopefully inspecting the neighbouring forest for
wolves, this able young man beheld a sotnia of Ural
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Cossacks galloping across the snow toward the flying
sleigh, where he and Estridge sat so snugly ensconced.</p>
<p>There was, of course, only one thing to do, and that
was to halt. Kaledines had blown his brains out, but
his riders rode as swiftly as ever. So the sleigh
stopped.</p>
<p>And now these matchless horsemen of the Wild Division
came galloping up around the sleigh. Brilliant
little slanting eyes glittered under shaggy head-gear;
broad, thick-lipped mouths split into grins at sight of
the two little American flags fluttering so gaily on
the sleigh.</p>
<p>Then two booted and furred riders climbed out of
their saddles, and, under their sheepskin caps, Brisson
saw the delicate features of two young women, one a
big, superb, blue-eyed girl; the other slim, dark-eyed,
and ivory-pale.</p>
<p>The latter said in English: &ldquo;Could you help us?
We saw the flags on your sleigh. We are trying to
leave the country. I am American. My name is
Palla Dumont. My friend is Swedish and her name
is Ilse Westgard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in, any way,&rdquo; said Brisson briskly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
be in a worse mess than we are. I imagine it&rsquo;s the
same case with you. So if we&rsquo;re all going to smash,
it&rsquo;s pleasanter, I think, to go together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the Swedish girl laughed and aided her
companion to enter the sleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; she called in her clear, gay voice to the
Cossacks. &ldquo;When we come back again we shall ride
with you from Vladivostok to Moscow and never see
an enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young women were comfortably ensconced
in the sleigh, the riders of the Wild Division crowded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
their horses around them and shook hands with them
English fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you come back,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;you shall find
us riding through Petrograd behind Korniloff!&rdquo; And
to Brisson and Estridge, in a friendly manner: &ldquo;Come
also, comrades. We will show you a monument made
out of heads and higher than the Kremlin. That
would be a funny joke and worth coming back to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brisson said pleasantly that such an exquisite jest
would be well worth their return to Russia.</p>
<p>Everybody seemed pleased; the Cossacks wheeled
their shaggy mounts and trotted away into the woods,
singing. The sleigh drove on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very jolly,&rdquo; said Brisson cheerfully. &ldquo;Wherever
we&rsquo;re bound for, now, we&rsquo;ll all go together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not America the destination of your long journey?&rdquo;
inquired the big, blue-eyed girl.</p>
<p>Brisson chuckled: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but bullets sometimes
shorten routes and alter destinations. I think
you ought to know the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the worst, it&rsquo;s nothing to frighten one,&rdquo;
said the Swedish girl. And her crystalline laughter
filled the icy air.</p>
<p>She put one persuasive arm around her slender,
dark-eyed comrade:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To meet God unexpectedly is nothing to scare one,
is it, Palla?&rdquo; she urged coaxingly.</p>
<p>The other reddened and her eyes flashed: &ldquo;What
God do you mean?&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;If I have anything
to say about my destination after death I shall
go wherever love is. And it does not dwell with the
God or in the Heaven that we have been taught to desire
and hope for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Swedish girl patted her shoulder and smiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
in good humoured deprecation at Brisson and Estridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God let her dearest friend die under the rifles of
the Reds,&rdquo; she explained cheerfully, &ldquo;and my little
comrade can not reconcile this sad affair with her faith
in Divine justice. So she concludes there isn&rsquo;t any such
thing. And no Divinity.&rdquo; She shrugged: &ldquo;That is
what shakes the faith in youth&ndash;&ndash;the seeming indifference
of the Most High.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla Dumont sat silent. The colour had died out
in her cheeks, her dark, indifferent eyes became fixed.</p>
<p>Estridge opened the fur collar of his coat and pulled
back his fur cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember me?&rdquo; he said to Ilse Westgard.</p>
<p>The girl laughed: &ldquo;Yes, I remember you, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Palla Dumont he said: &ldquo;And do <i>you</i> remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she looked up incuriously; leaned forward
slowly; gazed intently at him; then she caught both
his hands in hers with a swift, sobbing intake of
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are John Estridge,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You took me
to her in your ambulance!&rdquo; She pressed his hands
almost convulsively, and he felt her trembling under
the fur robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;that ghastly tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge turned to Brisson: &ldquo;Miss Dumont was
companion to the Grand Duchess Marie,&rdquo; he said in
brief explanation.</p>
<p>Brisson nodded, biting his cigar.</p>
<p>The Swedish girl-soldier said: &ldquo;They were devoted&ndash;&ndash;the
little Grand Duchess and Palla.... It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
was horrible, there in the convent cellar&ndash;&ndash;those young
girls&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She gazed out across the snow; then,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Reds who did it had already made me prisoner....
They arrested me in uniform after the decree
disbanding us.... I was on my way to join
Kaledines&rsquo; Cossacks&ndash;&ndash;a rendezvous.... Well,
the Reds left me outside the convent and went in to do
their bloody work. And I gnawed the rope and ran
into the chapel to hide among the nuns. And there I
saw a White Nun&ndash;&ndash;quite crazed with grief&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had heard the volley that killed her,&rdquo; said Palla,
in explanation, to nobody in particular. She sat staring
out across the snow with dry, bright eyes.</p>
<p>Brisson looked askance at her, looked significantly
at the Swedish girl, Ilse Westgard: &ldquo;And what happened
then?&rdquo; he inquired, with the pleasant, impersonal
manner of a physician.</p>
<p>Ilse said: &ldquo;Palla had already begun her novitiate.
But what happened in those terrible moments changed
her utterly.... I think she went mad at the
moment.... Then the Superior came to me
and begged me to hide Palla because the Bolsheviki
had promised to return and cut her throat when they
had finished their bloody business in the crypt....
So I caught her up in my arms and I ran out into the
convent grounds. And at that very moment, God be
thanked, a sotnia of the Wild Division rode up looking
for me. And they had led horses with them. And we
were in the saddle and riding like maniacs before I
could think. That is all, except, an hour ago we saw
your sleigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been hiding with the Cossacks ever since!&rdquo;
exclaimed Estridge to Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is her history,&rdquo; replied Ilse, &ldquo;and mine. And,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
she added cheerfully but tenderly, &ldquo;my little comrade,
here, is very, very homesick, very weary, very deeply and
profoundly unhappy in the loss of her closest friend...
and perhaps in the loss of her faith in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tranquil and I am not unhappy,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;said Palla.
&ldquo;And if I ever win free of this murderous country I
shall, for the first time in my life, understand what
the meaning of life really is. And shall know how
to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought you knew how to live when you took
the white veil,&rdquo; said Ilse cheerfully. &ldquo;Perhaps, after
all, you may make other errors before you learn the
truth about it all. Who knows? You might even care
to take the veil again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Palla in a clear, hard little voice,
tinged with the scorn and anger of that hot revolt
which sometimes shakes youth to the very source of
its vitality.</p>
<p>Ilse said very calmly to Estridge: &ldquo;With me it is
my reason and not mere hope that convinces me of
God&rsquo;s existence. I try to reason with Palla because
one is indeed to be pitied who has lost belief in God&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Palla drily; &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;one merely
becomes one&rsquo;s self when once the belief in that sort
of God is ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse turned to Brisson: &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is what
seems so impossible for some to accept&ndash;&ndash;so terrible&ndash;&ndash;the
apparent indifference, the lack of explanation&ndash;&ndash;God&rsquo;s
dreadful reticence in this thunderous whirlwind
of prayer that storms skyward day and night from
our martyred world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla, listening, sat forward and said to Brisson:
&ldquo;There is only one religion and it has only two precepts&ndash;&ndash;love
and give! The rest&ndash;&ndash;the forms, observances,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
creeds, ceremonies, threats, promises, are man-made
trash!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If man&rsquo;s man-made God pleases him, let him worship
him. That kind of deity does not please me. I
no longer care whether He pleases me or not. He no
longer exists as far as I am concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brisson, much interested, asked Palla whether the
void left by discredited Divinity did not bewilder her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no void,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;It is already
filled with my own kind of God, with millions of Gods&ndash;&ndash;my
own fellow creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fellow beings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think your fellow creatures can fill that void?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have filled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brisson nodded reflectively: &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said politely,
&ldquo;you intend to devote your life to the cult of your
fellow creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; said the girl tranquilly, &ldquo;but I
intend to love them and live my life that way unhampered.&rdquo;
She added almost fiercely: &ldquo;And I shall love
them the more because of their ignorant faith in an
all-seeing and tender and just Providence which does
not exist! I shall love them because of their tragic
deception and their helplessness and their heart-breaking
unconsciousness of it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse Westgard smiled and patted Palla&rsquo;s cheeks:
&ldquo;All roads lead ultimately to God,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and yours
is a direct route though you do not know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I have nothing in common with the God
you mean,&rdquo; flashed out the girl.</p>
<p>Brisson, though interested, kept one grey eye on
duty, ever hopeful of wolves. It was snowing hard
now&ndash;&ndash;a perfect geography scene, lacking only the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
wolves; but the &eacute;tape was only half finished. There
might be hope.</p>
<p>The rather amazing conversation in the sleigh also
appealed to him, arousing all his instincts of a veteran
newspaper man, as well as his deathless curiosity&ndash;&ndash;that
perpetual flame which alone makes any intelligence
vital.</p>
<p>Also, his passion for all documents&ndash;&ndash;those sewed
under his underclothes, as well as these two specimens
of human documents&ndash;&ndash;were now keeping his lively interest
in life unimpaired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loss of faith,&rdquo; he said to Palla, and inclined toward
further debate, &ldquo;must be a very serious thing for
any woman, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t lost faith in love,&rdquo; she said, smilingly
aware that he was encouraging discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you say you have lost faith in spiritual love&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say so. I did not mean the other kind of
love when I said that love is sufficient religion for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But spiritual love means Deity&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does <i>not</i>! Can you imagine the all-powerful
father watching his child die, horribly&ndash;&ndash;and never lifting
a finger! Is that love? Is that power? <i>Is</i> that
Deity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To penetrate the Divine mind and its motives for
not intervening is impossible for us&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is priest&rsquo;s prattle! Also, I care nothing now
about Divine motives. Motives are human, not divine.
So is policy. That is why the present Pope is unworthy
of respect. He let his flock die. He deserted
his Cardinal. He let the hun go unrebuked. He betrayed
Christ. I care nothing about any mind weak
enough, politic enough, powerless enough, to ignore
love for motives!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;One loves, or one does not love. Loving is giving&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
The girl sat up in the sleigh and the thickening
snowflakes drove into her flushed face. &ldquo;Loving
is giving,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;giving life to love; giving
<i>up</i> life for love&ndash;&ndash;giving! <i>giving!</i> always giving!&ndash;&ndash;always
forgiving! That is love! That is the only
God!&ndash;&ndash;the indestructible, divine God within each one
of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brisson appraised her with keen and scholarly
eyes. &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, &ldquo;you do not forgive
God for the death of your friend. Don&rsquo;t you practise
your faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl seemed nonplussed; then a brighter tint
stained her cheeks under the ragged sheepskin cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive God!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;If there really existed
that sort of God, what would be the use of forgiving
what He does? He&rsquo;d only do it again. That is His
record!&rdquo; she added fiercely, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;indifference to human
agony, utter silence amid lamentations, stone deaf,
stone dumb, motionless. It is not in me to fawn and
lick the feet of such an image. No! It is not in me
to believe it alive, either. And I do not! But I know
that love lives: and if there be any gods at all, it must
be that they are without number, and that their substance
is of that immortality born inside us, and which
we call love! Otherwise, to me, now, symbols, signs,
saints, rituals, vows&ndash;&ndash;these things, in my mind, are all
scrapped together as junk. Only, in me, the warm
faith remains&ndash;&ndash;that within me there lives a god of
sorts&ndash;&ndash;perhaps that immortal essence called a soul&ndash;&ndash;and
that its only name is love. And it has given us
only one law to live by&ndash;&ndash;the Law of Love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brisson&rsquo;s cigar had gone out. He examined it attentively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
and found it would be worth relighting when
opportunity offered.</p>
<p>Then he smiled amiably at Palla Dumont:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say is very interesting,&rdquo; he remarked.
But he was too polite to add that it had been equally
interesting to numberless generations through the many,
many centuries during which it all had been said
before, in various ways and by many, many people.</p>
<p>Lying back in his furs reflectively, and deriving a
rather cold satisfaction from his cigar butt, he let his
mind wander back through the history of theocracy
and of mundane philosophy, mildly amused to recognize
an ancient theory resurrected and made passionately
original once more on the red lips of this young
girl.</p>
<p>But the Law of Love is not destined to be solved
so easily; nor had it ever been solved in centuries dead
by Egyptian, Mongol, or Greek&ndash;&ndash;by priest or princess,
prophet or singer, or by any vestal or acolyte
of love, sacred or profane.</p>
<p>No philosophy had solved the problem of human
woe; no theory convinced. And Brisson, searching
leisurely the forgotten corridors of treasured lore, became
interested to realise that in all the history of
time only the deeds and example of one man had invested
the human theory of divinity with any real
vitality&ndash;&ndash;and that, oddly enough, what this girl
preached&ndash;&ndash;what she demanded of divinity&ndash;&ndash;had been
both preached and practised by that one man alone&ndash;&ndash;Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Turning involuntarily toward Palla, he said: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
you believe in Him, either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;He was one of the Gods. But He was
no more divine than any in whom love lives. Had He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
been more so, then He would still intervene to-day!
He is powerless. He lets things happen. And we ourselves
must make it up to the world by love. There is
no other divinity to intervene except only our own
hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that was not, as the young girl supposed, her
fixed faith, definite, ripened, unshakable. It was a phase
already in process of fading into other phases, each
less stable, less definite, and more dangerous than the
other, leaving her and her ardent mind and heart
always unconsciously drifting toward the simple, primitive
and natural goal for which all healthy bodies
are created and destined&ndash;&ndash;the instinct of the human
being to protect and perpetuate the race by the great
Law of Love.</p>
<p>Brisson&rsquo;s not unkindly cynicism had left his lips
edged with a slight smile. Presently he leaned back
beside Estridge and said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purely pathological. Ardent religious instinct
astray and running wild in consequence of nervous dislocations
due to shock. Merely over-storage of superb
physical energy. Intellectual and spiritual wires overcrowded.
Too many volts.... That girl ought
to have been married early. Only a lot of children can
keep her properly occupied. Only outlet for her kind.
Interesting case. Contrast to the Swedish girl. Fine,
handsome, normal animal that. She could pick me up
between thumb and finger. Great girl, Estridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is really beautiful,&rdquo; whispered Estridge, glancing
at Ilse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. So is Mont Blanc. That sort of beauty&ndash;&ndash;the
super-sort. But it&rsquo;s the other who is pathologically
interesting because her wires are crossed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
there&rsquo;s a short circuit somewhere. Who comes in contact
with her had better look out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s wonderfully attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is. But if she doesn&rsquo;t disentangle her wires
and straighten out she&rsquo;ll burn out.... What&rsquo;s
that ahead? A wolf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the rest house at the end of the &eacute;tape&ndash;&ndash;a
tiny, distant speck on the snowy plain.</p>
<p>Brisson leaned over and caught Palla&rsquo;s eye. Both
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for a girl who doesn&rsquo;t believe in
anything, you seem cheerful enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am cheerful because I <i>do</i> believe in everything
and in everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brisson laughed: &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Great
mistake. Trust in God and believe nobody&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s the
idea. Then get married and close your eyes and see
what God will send you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl threw back her pretty head and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage and priests are of no consequence,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but I adore little children!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>They were a weary, half-starved and travel-stained
quartette when the Red Guards stopped
them for the last time in Russia and passed
them through, warning them that the White Guards
would surely do murder if they caught them.</p>
<p>The next day the White Guards halted them, but
finally passed them through, counselling them to keep
out of the way of the Red Guards if they wished to
escape being shot at sight.</p>
<p>In the neat, shiny, carefully scrubbed little city of
Helsingfors they avoided the huns by some miracle&ndash;&ndash;one
of Brisson&rsquo;s customary miracles&ndash;&ndash;but another little
company of Americans and English was halted and detained,
and one harmless Yankee among them was arrested
and packed off to a hun prison.</p>
<p>Also, a large and nervous party of fugitives of
mixed nationalities and professions&ndash;&ndash;consuls, charg&eacute;s,
attach&eacute;s, and innocent, agitated citizens&ndash;&ndash;was summarily
grabbed and ordered into indefinite limbo.</p>
<p>But Brisson&rsquo;s daily miracles continued to materialise,
even in the land of the Finn. By train, by sleigh,
by boat, his quartette floundered along toward safety,
and finally emerged from the white hell of the Red
people into the sub-arctic sun&ndash;&ndash;Estridge with painfully
scanty luggage, Palla Dumont with none at all,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
Ilse Westgard carrying only her Cossack saddle-bags,
and Brisson with his damning papers still sewed inside
his clothes, and owing Estridge ten dollars for not
getting murdered.</p>
<p>They all had become excellent comrades during those
anxious days of hunger, fatigue and common peril, but
they were also a little tired of one another, as becomes
all friends when subjected to compulsory companionship
for an unreasonable period.</p>
<p>And even when one is beginning to fall in love, one
can become surfeited with the beloved under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Besides, Estridge&rsquo;s budding sentiment for Ilse Westgard,
and her wholesome and girlish inclination for him,
suffered an early chill. For the poor child had acquired
trench pets from the Cossacks, and had passed
on a few to Estridge, with whom she had been constantly
seated on the front seat.</p>
<p>Being the frankest thing in Russia, she told him
with tears in her blue eyes; and they had a most horrid
time of it before they came finally to a sanitary plant
erected to attend to such matters.</p>
<p>Episodes of that sort discourage sentiment; so does
cold, hunger and discomfort incident on sardine-like
promiscuousness.</p>
<p>Nobody in the party desired to know more than they
already knew concerning anybody else. In fact, there
was little more to know, privacy being impossible.
And the ever instinctive hostility of the two sexes,
always and irrevocably latent, became vaguely apparent
at moments.</p>
<p>Common danger swept it away at times; but reaction
gradually revealed again what is born under the
human skin&ndash;&ndash;the paradox called sex-antipathy. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
yet the men in the party would not have hesitated to
sacrifice their lives in defence of these women, nor
would the women have faltered under the same test.</p>
<p>Brisson was the philosophical stoic of the quartette.
Estridge groused sometimes. Palla, when she thought
herself unnoticed, camouflaged her face in her furs and
cried now and then. And occasionally Ilse Westgard
tried the patience of the others by her healthy capacity
for unfeigned laughter&ndash;&ndash;sometimes during danger-laden
and inopportune moments, and once in the shocking
imminence of death itself.</p>
<p>As, for example, in a vile little village, full of vermin
and typhus, some hunger-crazed peasants, armed with
stolen rifles and ammunition, awoke them where they
lay on the straw of a stable, cursed them for aristocrats,
and marched them outside to a convenient wall,
at the foot of which sprawled half a dozen blood-soaked,
bayoneted and bullet-riddled landlords and land owners
of the district.</p>
<p>And things had assumed a terribly serious aspect
when, to their foolish consternation, the peasants discovered
that their purloined cartridges did not fit their
guns.</p>
<p>Then, in the very teeth of death, Ilse threw back
her blond head and laughed. And there was no mistaking
the genuineness of the girl&rsquo;s laughter.</p>
<p>Some of their would-be executioners laughed too;&ndash;&ndash;the
hilarity spread. It was all over; they couldn&rsquo;t
shoot a girl who laughed that way. So somebody
brought a samovar; tea was boiled; and they all went
back to the barn and sat there drinking tea and swapping
gossip and singing until nearly morning.</p>
<p>That was a sample of their narrow escapes. But
Brisson&rsquo;s only comment before he went to sleep was that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
Estridge would probably owe him a dollar within the
next twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>They had a hair-raising time in Helsingfors. On
one occasion, German officers forced Palla&rsquo;s door at
night, and the girl became ill with fear while soldiers
searched the room, ordering her out of bed and pushing
her into a corner while they ripped up carpets
and tore the place to pieces in a swinishly ferocious
search for &ldquo;information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they did nothing worse to her, and, for some
reason, left the hotel without disturbing Brisson, whose
room adjoined and who sat on the edge of his bed with
an automatic in each hand&ndash;&ndash;a dangerous opportunist
awaiting events and calmly determined to do some recruiting
for hell if the huns harmed Palla.</p>
<p>She never knew that. And the worst was over now,
and the Scandinavian border not far away. And in
twenty-four hours they were over&ndash;&ndash;Brisson impatient
to get his papers to Washington and planning to
start for England on a wretched little packet-boat, in
utter contempt of mines, U-boats, and the icy menace
of the North Sea.</p>
<p>As for the others, Estridge decided to cable and
await orders in Copenhagen; Palla, to sail for home
on the first available Danish steamer; Ilse, to go to
Stockholm and eventually decide whether to volunteer
once more as a soldier of the proletariat or to turn
propagandist and carry the true gospel to America,
where, she had heard, the ancient liberties of the great
Democracy were becoming imperilled.</p>
<p>The day before they parted company, these four
people, so oddly thrown together out of the boiling
cauldron of the Russian Terror, arranged to dine
together for the last time.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>Theirs were the appetites of healthy wolves; theirs
was the thirst of the marooned on waterless islands; and
theirs, too, was the feverish gaiety of those who had
escaped great peril by land and sea; and who were
still physically and morally demoralized by the glare
and the roar of the hellish conflagration which was
still burning up the world around them.</p>
<p>So they met in a private dining room of the hotel
for dinner on the eve of separation.</p>
<p>Brisson and Estridge had resurrected from their
luggage the remains of their evening attire; Ilse and
Palla had shopped; and they now included in a limited
wardrobe two simple dinner gowns, among more vital
purchases.</p>
<p>There were flowers on the table, no great variety of
food but plenty of champagne to make up&ndash;&ndash;a singular
innovation in apology for short rations conceived by
the hotel proprietor.</p>
<p>There was a victrola in the corner, too, and this
they kept going to stimulate their nerves, which
already were sufficiently on edge without the added
fillip of music and champagne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; said Brisson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in sight of nervous
dissolution already;&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going back to my wife and
children, thank God&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he smiled at Palla. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful
to the God you don&rsquo;t believe in, dear little lady.
And if He is willing, I&rsquo;ll report for duty in two weeks.&rdquo;
He turned to Estridge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve cabled for orders but I have none yet. If
they&rsquo;re through with me I shall go back to New York
and back to the medical school I came from. I hate
the idea, too. Lord, how I detest it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Palla nervously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had too much excitement. You have too&ndash;&ndash;and
so have Ilse and Brisson. I&rsquo;m not keen for the
usual again. It bores me to contemplate it. The
thought of Fifth Avenue&ndash;&ndash;the very idea of going back
to all that familiar routine, social and business, makes
me positively ill. What a dull place this world will
be when we&rsquo;re all at peace again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be at peace for a long, long while,&rdquo; said
Ilse, smiling. She lifted a goblet in her big, beautifully
shaped hand and drained it with the vigorous
grace of a Viking&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think the war is going to last for years?&rdquo;
asked Estridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; not this war. But the other,&rdquo; she explained
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the greatest conflict in the world; the social
war. It&rsquo;s going to take many years and many battles.
I shall enlist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Brisson, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not a Red!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed and showed her snowy teeth: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
one kind of Red&ndash;&ndash;not the kind that sold Russia to the
boche&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;m very, very red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody with a brain and a heart is more or
less red in these days,&rdquo; nodded Palla. &ldquo;Everybody
knows that the old order is ended&ndash;&ndash;done for. Without
liberty and equal opportunity civilisation is a farce.
Everybody knows it except the stupid. And they&rsquo;ll
have to be instructed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Brisson briskly, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s to the universal
but bloodless revolution! An acre for everybody
and a mule to plough it! Back to the soil and to hell
with the counting house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed, but their brimming glasses went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
up; then Estridge rose to re-wind the victrola. Palla&rsquo;s
slim foot tapped the parquet in time with the American
fox-trot; she glanced across the table at Estridge,
lifted her head interrogatively, then sprang up and
slid into his arms, delighted.</p>
<p>While they danced he said: &ldquo;Better go light on that
champagne, Miss Dumont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I can keep my head?&rdquo; she demanded
derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you keep up with Ilse. You&rsquo;re not built
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were. I wish I were nearly six feet tall
and beautiful in every limb and feature as she is. What
wonderful children she could have! What magnificent
hair she must have had before she sheared it for the
Woman&rsquo;s Battalion! Now it&rsquo;s all a dense, short mass
of gold&ndash;&ndash;she looks like a lovely boy who requires a
barber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hair is not unbecoming, either,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;short as it is, it&rsquo;s a mop of curls and very fetching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it funny?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I sheared mine for the
sake of Mother Church; Ilse cut off hers for the honour
of the Army! Now we&rsquo;re both out of a job&ndash;&ndash;with
only our cropped heads to show for the experience!&ndash;&ndash;and
no more army and no more church&ndash;&ndash;at least,
as far as I am concerned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she threw back hers with its thick, glossy curls
and laughed, looking up at him out of her virginal
brown eyes of a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I cut my hair,&rdquo; she added presently. &ldquo;I
look like a Bolshevik.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s growing very fast,&rdquo; he said encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it grows fast,&rdquo; she nodded indifferently.
&ldquo;Shall we return to the table? I am rather thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>Ilse and Brisson were engaged in an animated conversation
when they reseated themselves. The waiter
arrived about that time with another course of poor
food.</p>
<p>Palla, disregarding Estridge&rsquo;s advice, permitted the
waiter to refill her glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat that unappetising entr&eacute;e,&rdquo; she insisted,
&ldquo;and champagne, they say, is nourishing and I&rsquo;m still
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said Brisson; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve had two
glasses already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she retorted childishly; &ldquo;I mean to
live to the utmost in future. For the first time in my
silly existence I intend to be natural. I wonder what
it feels like to become a little intoxicated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels rotten,&rdquo; remarked Estridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? <i>How</i> rotten?&rdquo; She laughed again, laid
her hand on the goblet&rsquo;s stem and glanced across at
him defiantly, mischievously. However, she seemed
to reconsider the matter, for she picked up a cigarette
and lighted it at a candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she exclaimed with a wry face. &ldquo;It stings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she ventured another puff or two before placing
it upon a saucer among its defunct fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; she complained again with a gay little shiver,
and bit into a pear as though to wash out the contamination
of unaccustomed nicotine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going when we all say good-bye?&rdquo;
inquired Estridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Oh, I&rsquo;m certainly going home on the first Danish
boat&ndash;&ndash;home to Shadow Hill, where I told you I
lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have nobody but your aunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that one old lady.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t remain long at Shadow Hill,&rdquo; he predicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very pretty there. Why don&rsquo;t you think I am
likely to remain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t remain,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve slipped
your cable. You&rsquo;re hoisting sail. And it worries me
a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty place, Shadow
Hill, but it&rsquo;s dull. Everybody in the town is dull,
stupid, and perfectly satisfied: everybody owns at least
that acre which Ilse demands; there&rsquo;s no discontent at
Shadow Hill, and no reason for it. I really couldn&rsquo;t
bear it,&rdquo; she added gaily; &ldquo;I want to go where there&rsquo;s
healthy discontent, wholesome competition, natural aspiration&ndash;&ndash;where
things must be bettered, set right,
helped. You understand? That is where I wish to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brisson heard her. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you practise your loving
but godless creed at Shadow Hill?&rdquo; he inquired, amused.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you lavish love on the contented and well-to-do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Brisson,&rdquo; she replied with sweet irony,
&ldquo;but where the poor and loveless fight an ever losing
battle is still a better place for me to practise my
godless creed and my Law of Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;a brand new excuse for living
in New York because all young girls love it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she said with some little heat, &ldquo;I certainly
do intend to live and not to stagnate! I intend to live
as hard as I can&ndash;&ndash;live and enjoy life with all my
might! Can one serve the world better than by loving
it enough to live one&rsquo;s own life through to the last
happy rags? Can one give one&rsquo;s fellow creatures a
better example than to live every moment happily and
proclaim the world good to live in, and mankind good
to live with?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>Ilse whispered, leaning near: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take any more
champagne, Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl frowned, then looked serious: &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
she said na&iuml;vely. &ldquo;But it is wonderful how eloquent
it makes one feel, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to Estridge: &ldquo;You know that this is quite
the first wine I have ever tasted&ndash;&ndash;except at Communion.
I was brought up to think it meant destruction.
And afterward, wherever I travelled to study,
the old prejudice continued to guide me. And after
that, even when I began to think of taking the veil, I
made abstinence one of my first preliminary vows....
And <i>look</i> what I&rsquo;ve been doing to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held up her glass, tasted it, emptied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I desired to shock you. I don&rsquo;t
really want any more. Shall we dance? Ilse! Why
don&rsquo;t you seize Mr. Brisson and make him two-step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please seize me,&rdquo; added Brisson gravely.</p>
<p>Ilse rose, big, fresh, smilingly inviting; Brisson inspected
her seriously&ndash;&ndash;he was only half as tall&ndash;&ndash;then
he politely encircled her waist and led her out.</p>
<p>They danced as though they could not get enough
of it&ndash;&ndash;exhilaration due to reaction from the long strain
during dangerous days.</p>
<p>It was already morning, but they danced on. Palla&rsquo;s
delicate intoxication passed&ndash;&ndash;returned&ndash;&ndash;passed&ndash;&ndash;hovered
like a rosy light in her brain, but faded always
as she danced.</p>
<p>There were snapping-crackers and paper caps; and
they put them on and pelted each other with the drooping
table flowers.</p>
<p>Then Estridge went to the piano and sang an
ancient song, called &ldquo;The Cork Leg&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;not very well&ndash;&ndash;but
well intended and in a gay and inoffensive voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>But Ilse sang some wonderful songs which she had
learned in the Battalion of Death.</p>
<p>And that is what was being done when a waiter
knocked and asked whether they might desire to order
breakfast.</p>
<p>That ended it. The hour of parting had arrived.</p>
<p>No longer bored with one another, they shook hands
cordially, regretfully.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was not a very long time, as time is computed,
before these four met again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>The dingy little Danish steamer <i>Elsinore</i> passed
in at dawn, her camouflage obscured by sea-salt,
her few passengers still prostrated from
the long battering administered by the giant seas of the
northern route.</p>
<p>A lone Yankee soldier was aboard&ndash;&ndash;an indignant
lieutenant of infantry named Shotwell&ndash;&ndash;sent home
from a fighting regiment to instruct the ambitious
rookie at Camp Upton.</p>
<p>He had hailed his assignment with delight, thankfully
rid himself of his cooties, reported in Paris, reported
in London; received orders to depart via Denmark;
and, his mission there fullfilled, he had sailed on
the <i>Elsinore</i>, already disenchanted with his job and
longing to be back with his regiment.</p>
<p>And now, surly from sea-sickness, worried by peace
rumours, but still believing that the war would last
another year and hopeful of getting back before it
ended, he emerged from his stuffy quarters aboard the
<i>Elsinore</i> and gazed without enthusiasm at the minarets
of Coney Island, now visible off the starboard
bow.</p>
<p>Near him, in pasty-faced and shaky groups, huddled
his fellow passengers, whom he had not seen during
the voyage except when lined up for life-drill.</p>
<p>He had not wished to see them, either, nor, probably,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
had they desired to lavish social attentions on him or
upon one another.</p>
<p>These pallid, discouraged voyagers were few&ndash;&ndash;not
two dozen cabin passengers in all.</p>
<p>Who they might be he had no curiosity to know; he
had not exchanged ten words with any of them during
the entire and nauseating voyage; he certainly did
not intend to do so now.</p>
<p>He favoured them with a savage glance and walked
over to the port side&ndash;&ndash;the Jersey side&ndash;&ndash;where there
seemed to be nobody except a tired Scandinavian
sailor or two.</p>
<p>In the grey of morning the Hook loomed up above
the sea, gloomy as a thunder-head charged with lightning.</p>
<p>After a while the batteries along the Narrows slipped
into view. Farther on, camouflaged ships rode
sullenly at anchor, as though ashamed of their frivolous
and undignified appearance. A battleship was
just leaving the Lower Bay, smoke pouring from every
funnel. Destroyers and chasers rushed by them, headed
seaward.</p>
<p>Then, high over the shore mists and dimly visible
through rising vapours, came speeding a colossal
phantom.</p>
<p>Vague as a shark&rsquo;s long shadow sheering translucent
depths, the huge dirigible swept eastward and
slid into the Long Island fog.</p>
<p>And at that moment somebody walked plump into
young Shotwell; and the soft, fragrant shock knocked
the breath out of both.</p>
<p>She recovered hers first:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;It was stupid. I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
watching the balloon and not looking where I was
going. I&rsquo;m afraid I hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He recovered his breath, saluted ceremoniously, readjusted
his overseas cap to the proper angle.</p>
<p>Then he said, civilly enough: &ldquo;It was my fault entirely.
It was I who walked into you. I hope I didn&rsquo;t
hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They smiled, unembarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was certainly a big dirigible,&rdquo; he ventured.
&ldquo;There are bigger Zeps, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. But they&rsquo;re not much good in war, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her trim, small head and looked out
across the bay; and Shotwell, who once had had a
gaily receptive eye for pulchritude, thought her unusually
pretty.</p>
<p>Also, the steady keel of the <i>Elsinore</i> was making
him feel more human now; and he ventured a further
polite observation concerning the pleasures of homecoming
after extended exile.</p>
<p>She turned with a frank shake of her head: &ldquo;It seems
heartless to say so, but I&rsquo;m rather sorry I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>He smiled: &ldquo;I must admit,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;that I
feel the same way. Of course I want to see my people.
But I&rsquo;d give anything to be in France at this moment,
and that&rsquo;s the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded her comprehension: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite
natural,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;One does not wish to come
home until this thing is settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly. It&rsquo;s like leaving an interesting
play half finished. It&rsquo;s worse&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s like leaving an absorbing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
drama in which you yourself are playing an
exciting r&ocirc;le.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at him&ndash;&ndash;a quick glance of intelligent
appraisal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it must have seemed that way to you. But
I&rsquo;ve been merely one among a breathless audience....
And yet I can&rsquo;t bear to leave in the very middle&ndash;&ndash;not
knowing how it is to end. Besides,&rdquo; she added carelessly,
&ldquo;I have nobody to come back to except a rather
remote relative, so my regrets are unmixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There ensued a silence. He was afraid she was
about to go, but couldn&rsquo;t seem to think of anything
to say to detain her.</p>
<p>For the girl was very attractive to a careless and
amiably casual man of his sort&ndash;&ndash;the sort who start
their little journey through life with every intention
of having the best kind of a time on the way.</p>
<p>She was so distractingly pretty, so confidently negligent
of convention&ndash;&ndash;or perhaps disdainful of it&ndash;&ndash;that
he already was regretting that he had not met her at
the beginning of the voyage instead of at the end.</p>
<p>She had now begun to button up her ulster, as though
preliminary to resuming her deck promenade. And he
wanted to walk with her. But because she had chosen
to be informal with him did not deceive him into thinking
that she was likely to tolerate further informality
on his part. And yet he had a vague notion that her
inclinations were friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said rather stupidly, &ldquo;that I didn&rsquo;t
meet you in the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slightest inclination of her head indicated that
although possibly she might be sorry too, regrets were
now useless. Then she turned up the collar of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
ulster. The face it framed was disturbingly lovely.
And he took a last chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he ventured politely, &ldquo;you have really
been on board the <i>Elsinore</i> all this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her charming head toward him, considered
him a moment; then she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on board all the time.
I didn&rsquo;t crawl aboard in mid-ocean, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was frankly amused by the streak of boyishness
in him&ndash;&ndash;the perfectly transparent desire of
this young man to detain her in conversation. And,
still amused, she leaned back against the rail. If he
wanted to talk to her she would let him&ndash;&ndash;even help
him. Why not?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a wound chevron?&rdquo; she inquired, looking
at the sleeve of his tunic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied gratefully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a service stripe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does the little cord around your shoulder
signify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That my regiment was cited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For bravery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;that was the idea, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been in action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the top?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several. Recently it&rsquo;s been more open work, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were not hit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She regarded him smilingly: &ldquo;You are like all soldiers
have faced death,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are not communicative.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>At that he reddened. &ldquo;Well, everybody else was
facing it, too, you know. We all had the same experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; she said, watching him. &ldquo;Some died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face flushed and she nodded emphatically:
&ldquo;Of course! And <i>that</i> is our Yankee secret;&ndash;&ndash;embodied
in those two words&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;of course.&rsquo; That is exactly why
the boche runs away from our men. The boche doesn&rsquo;t
know why he runs, but it is because you all say, &lsquo;of
course!&ndash;&ndash;of course we&rsquo;re here to kill and get killed.
What of it? It&rsquo;s in the rules of the game, isn&rsquo;t it?
Very well; we&rsquo;re playing the game!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the rules of the hun game are different. According
to their rules, machine guns are not charged
on. That is not according to plan. Oh, no! But it is
in your rules of the game. So after the boche has
killed a number of you, and you say, &lsquo;of course,&rsquo; and
you keep coming on, it first bewilders the boche, then
terrifies him. And the next time he sees you coming
he takes to his heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell, amused, fascinated, and entirely surprised,
began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know the game pretty well yourself,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You are quite right. That is the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful game,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;I can understand
why you are not pleased at being ordered home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather rotten luck when the outfit had just been
cited,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. I should think you <i>would</i> hate to come back!&rdquo;
exclaimed the girl, with frank sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was glad at first, but I&rsquo;m sorry now. I&rsquo;m
missing a lot, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did they send you back?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;To instruct rookies!&rdquo; he said with a grimace.
&ldquo;Rather inglorious, isn&rsquo;t it? But I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll have
time to weather this detail and get back again before
we reach the Rhine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get back again, too,&rdquo; she reflected aloud,
biting her lip and letting her dark eyes rest on the
foggy statue of Liberty, towering up ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was your branch?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; she exclaimed, flushing.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in Russia. And now I must find out at once
what I can do to be sent to France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The war caught you over there, I suppose,&rdquo; he
hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... I&rsquo;ve been there since I was twenty.
I&rsquo;m twenty-four. I had a year&rsquo;s travel and study
and then I became the American companion of the
little Russian Grand Duchess Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all were murdered, weren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he asked,
much interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... I&rsquo;m trying to forget&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite all right. I, myself, mentioned it first;
but I can&rsquo;t talk about it yet. It&rsquo;s too personal&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
She turned and looked at the monstrous city.</p>
<p>After a silence: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a rotten voyage, hasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly rotten. I was so ill I could scarcely keep
my place during life-drill.... I didn&rsquo;t see you
there,&rdquo; she added with a faint smile, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure
you were aboard, even if you seem to doubt that I
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, perhaps considering that she had been
sufficiently amiable to him, she gave him his cong&eacute; with
a pleasant little nod.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Could I help you&ndash;&ndash;do anything&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began. But
she thanked him with friendly finality.</p>
<p>They sauntered in opposite directions; and he did
not see her again to speak to her.</p>
<p>Later, jolting toward home in a taxi, it occurred
to him that it might have been agreeable to see such
an attractively informal girl again. Any man likes
informality in women, except among the women of his
own household, where he would promptly brand it as
indiscretion.</p>
<p>He thought of her for a while, recollecting details
of the episode and realising that he didn&rsquo;t even know
her name. Which piqued him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves me right,&rdquo; he said aloud with a shrug of
finality. &ldquo;I had more enterprise once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he looked out into the sunlit streets of Manhattan,
all brilliant with flags and posters and swarming
with prosperous looking people&ndash;&ndash;his own people.
But to his war-enlightened and disillusioned eyes his
own people seemed almost like aliens; he vaguely resented
their too evident prosperity, their irresponsible
immunity, their heedless preoccupation with the petty
things of life. The acres of bright flags fluttering
above them, the posters that made a gay back-ground
for the scene, the sheltered, undisturbed routine of
peace seemed to annoy him.</p>
<p>An odd irritation invaded him; he had a sudden impulse
to stop his taxi and shout, &ldquo;Fat-heads! Get into
the game! Don&rsquo;t you know the world&rsquo;s on fire? Don&rsquo;t
you know what a hun really is? You&rsquo;d better look
out and get busy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifth Avenue irritated him&ndash;&ndash;shops, hotels, clubs,
motors, the well-dressed throngs began to exasperate
him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>On a side street he caught a glimpse of his own
place of business; and it almost nauseated him to remember
old man Sharrow, and the walls hung with
plans of streets and sewers and surveys and photographs;
and his own yellow oak desk&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;If the war ends, have
I got to go back to that!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The family were at breakfast when he walked in on
them&ndash;&ndash;only two&ndash;&ndash;his father and mother.</p>
<p>In his mother&rsquo;s arms he suddenly felt very young
and subdued, and very glad to be there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the devil did you come from, Jim?&rdquo; repeated
his father, with twitching features and a grip on his
son&rsquo;s strong hand that he could not bring himself to
loosen.</p>
<p>Yes, it was pretty good to get home, after all&ndash;&ndash; ... And
he might not have come back at all. He
realised it, now, in his mother&rsquo;s arms, feeling very
humble and secure.</p>
<p>His mother had realised it, too, in every waking hour
since the day her only son had sailed at night&ndash;&ndash;that
had been the hardest!&ndash;&ndash;at night&ndash;&ndash;and at an unnamed
hour of an unnamed day!&ndash;&ndash;her only son&ndash;&ndash;gone in the
darkness&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>On his way upstairs, he noticed a red service flag
bearing a single star hanging in his mother&rsquo;s window.</p>
<p>He went into his own room, looked soberly around,
sat down on the lounge, suddenly tired.</p>
<p>He had three days&rsquo; leave before reporting for duty.
It seemed a miserly allowance. Instinctively he glanced
at his wrist-watch. An hour had fled already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dickens!&rdquo; he muttered. But he still sat there.
After a while he smiled to himself and rose leisurely to
make his toilet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Such an attractively informal girl,&rdquo; he thought regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t learn her name. Why didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philosophy might have answered: &ldquo;But to what purpose?
No young man expects to pick up a girl of his
own kind. And he has no business with other kinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Shotwell was no philosopher.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The &ldquo;attractively informal girl,&rdquo; on whom young
Shotwell was condescending to bestow a passing regret
while changing his linen, had, however, quite forgotten
him by this time. There is more philosophy in women.</p>
<p>Her train was now nearing Shadow Hill; she already
could see the village in its early winter nakedness&ndash;&ndash;the
stone bridge, the old-time houses of the well-to-do,
Main Street full of automobiles and farmers&rsquo; wagons,
a crowded trolley-car starting for Deepdale, the county
seat.</p>
<p>After four years the crudity of it all astonished her&ndash;&ndash;the
stark vulgarity of Main Street in the sunshine,
every mean, flimsy architectural detail revealed&ndash;&ndash;the
dingy trolley poles, the telegraph poles loaded with
unlovely wires and battered little electric light fixtures&ndash;&ndash;the
uncompromising, unrelieved ugliness of street
and people, of shop and vehicle, of treeless sidewalks,
brick pavement, car rails, hydrants, and rusty gasoline
pumps.</p>
<p>Here was a people ignorant of civic pride, knowing
no necessity for beauty, having no standards, no aspirations,
conscious of nothing but the grosser material
needs.</p>
<p>The hopelessness of this American town&ndash;&ndash;and there
were thousands like it&ndash;&ndash;its architectural squalor, its
animal unconsciousness, shocked her after four years
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
in lands where colour, symmetry and good taste are
indigenous and beauty as necessary as bread.</p>
<p>And the girl had been born here, too; had known no
other home except when at boarding school or on shopping
trips to New York.</p>
<p>Painfully depressed, she descended at the station,
where she climbed into one of the familiar omnibuses
and gave her luggage check to the lively young driver.</p>
<p>Several drummers also got in, and finally a farmer
whom she recognised but who had evidently forgotten
her.</p>
<p>The driver, a talkative young man whom she remembered
as an obnoxious boy who delivered newspapers,
came from the express office with her trunk,
flung it on top of the bus, gossiped with several station
idlers, then leisurely mounted his seat and gathered
up the reins.</p>
<p>Rattling along the main street she became aware of
changes&ndash;&ndash;a brand new yellow brick clothing store&ndash;&ndash;a
dreadful Quick Lunch&ndash;&ndash;a moving picture theatre&ndash;&ndash;other
monstrosities. And she saw familiar faces on
the street.</p>
<p>The drummers got out with their sample cases at
the Bolton House&ndash;&ndash;Charles H. Bolton, proprietor.
The farmer descended at the &ldquo;Par Excellence Market,&rdquo;
where, as he informed the driver, he expected to dispose
of a bull calf which he had finally decided &ldquo;to veal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; inquired the driver, looking
in at her through the door and chewing gum very
fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Miss Dumont&rsquo;s on Shadow Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!...&rdquo; Then, suddenly he knew her.
&ldquo;Say, wasn&rsquo;t you her niece?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> Miss Dumont&rsquo;s niece,&rdquo; replied Palla, smiling.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! I didn&rsquo;t reckonise you. Used to leave the
<i>Star</i> on your doorstep! Been away, ain&rsquo;t you? Home
looks kinda good to you, even if it&rsquo;s kinda lonesome&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
He checked himself as though recollecting
something else. &ldquo;Sure! You been over in Rooshia
livin&rsquo; with the Queen! There was a piece in the <i>Star</i>
about it. Gee!&rdquo; he added affably. &ldquo;That was pretty
soft! Some life, I bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he grinned a genial grin and climbed into his
seat, chewing rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means to be friendly,&rdquo; thought the heart-sick
girl, with a shudder.</p>
<p>When Palla got out she spoke pleasantly to him as
she paid him, and inquired about his father&ndash;&ndash;a shiftless
old gaffer who used, sometimes, to do garden work
for her aunt.</p>
<p>But the driver, obsessed by the fact that she had
lived with the &ldquo;Queen of Rooshia,&rdquo; merely grinned and
repeated, &ldquo;Pretty soft,&rdquo; and, shouldering her trunk,
walked to the front door, chewing furiously.</p>
<p>Martha opened the door, stared through her spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land o&rsquo; mercy!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Palla!&rdquo; Which,
in Shadow Hill, is the manner and speech of the &ldquo;hired
girl,&rdquo; whose &ldquo;folks&rdquo; are &ldquo;neighbours&rdquo; and not inferiors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Martha,&rdquo; said the girl smilingly;
and offered her gloved hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m so&rsquo;s to be &rsquo;round&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She wheeled on the
man with the trunk: &ldquo;Here, <i>you</i>! Don&rsquo;t go-a-trackin&rsquo;
mud all over my carpet like that! Wipe your feet
like as if you was brought up respectful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I wipin&rsquo; em?&rdquo; retorted the driver, in an injured
voice. &ldquo;Now then, Marthy, where does this here
trunk go to?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Big room front&ndash;&ndash;wait, young fellow; you just
follow me and be careful don&rsquo;t bang the banisters&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half way up she called back over her shoulder: &ldquo;Your
room&rsquo;s all ready, Palla&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and suddenly remembered
something else and stood aside on the landing until
the young man with the trunk had passed her; then
waited for him to return and get himself out of the
house. Then, when he had gone out, banging the door,
she came slowly back down the stairs and met Palla
ascending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is my aunt?&rdquo; asked Palla.</p>
<p>And, as Martha remained silent, gazing oddly down
at her through her glasses:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt isn&rsquo;t ill, is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t ill. H&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get my letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Your</i> letter? Why did <i>you</i> write? What is the
matter? Where is my aunt?&rdquo; asked the disturbed girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote you last month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> did you write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t! What has happened to my aunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had a stroke, Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Is&ndash;&ndash;is she dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six weeks ago come Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s knees weakened and she sat down suddenly
on the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead? My Aunt Emeline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had a stroke a year ago. It made her a little
stiff in one leg. But she wouldn&rsquo;t tell you&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&rsquo;t
bother you. She was that proud of you living as you
did with all those kings and queens. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; sez she to me,
&lsquo;no, Martha, I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to worry Palla. She and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the Queen have got their hands full, what with the
wicked way those Rooshian people are behaving. No,&rsquo;
sez she, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll git well by the time she comes home for
a visit after the war&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martha&rsquo;s spectacles became dim. She seated herself
on the stairs and wiped them on her apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came in the night,&rdquo; she said, peering blindly at
Palla.... &ldquo;I wondered why she was late to breakfast.
When I went up she was lying there with her
eyes open&ndash;&ndash;just as natural&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s head dropped and she covered her face with
both hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>There remained, now, nothing to keep Palla in
Shadow Hill.</p>
<p>She had never intended to stay there, anyway;
she had meant to go to France.</p>
<p>But already there appeared to be no chance for that
in the scheme of things. For the boche had begun to
squeal for mercy; the frightened swine was squirting
life-blood as he rushed headlong for the home sty
across the Rhine; his death-stench sickened the world.</p>
<p>Thicker, ranker, reeked the bloody abomination in
the nostrils of civilisation, where Justice strode ahead
through hell&rsquo;s own devastation, kicking the boche to
death, kicking him through Belgium, through France,
out of Light back into Darkness, back, back to his
stinking sty.</p>
<p>The rushing sequence of events in Europe since Palla&rsquo;s
arrival in America bewildered the girl and held in abeyance
any plan she had hoped to make.</p>
<p>The whole world waited, too, astounded, incredulous
as yet of the cataclysmic debacle, slowly realising that
the super-swine were but swine&ndash;&ndash;maddened swine, devil
driven. And that the Sea was very near.</p>
<p>No romance ever written approached in wild extravagance
the story of doom now unfolding in the daily
papers.</p>
<p>Palla read and strove to comprehend&ndash;&ndash;read, laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
aside her paper, and went about her own business, which
alone seemed dully real.</p>
<p>And these new personal responsibilities&ndash;&ndash;now that her
aunt was dead&ndash;&ndash;must have postponed any hope of an
immediate departure for France.</p>
<p>Her inheritance under her aunt&rsquo;s will, the legal details,
the inventory of scattered acreage and real estate,
plans for their proper administration, consultations
with an attorney, conferences with Mr. Pawling, president
of the local bank&ndash;&ndash;such things had occupied and
involved her almost from the moment of her arrival
home.</p>
<p>At first the endless petty details exasperated her&ndash;&ndash;a
girl fresh from the tremendous tragedy of things
where, one after another, empires were crashing amid
the conflagration of a continent. And she could not
now keep her mind on such wretched little personal
matters while her heart battered passionately at her
breast, sounding the exciting summons to active service.</p>
<p>To concentrate her thoughts on mortgages and deeds
when she was burning to be on her way to France&ndash;&ndash;to
confer power of attorney, audit bills for taxes, for
up-keep of line fences, when she was mad to go to New
York and find out how quickly she could be sent to
France&ndash;&ndash;such things seemed more than a girl could
endure.</p>
<p>In Shadow Hill there was scarcely anything to remind
her that the fate of the world was being settled
for all time.</p>
<p>Only for red service flags here and there, here and
there a burly figure in olive-drab swaggering along
Main Street, nothing except war-bread, the shortage
of coal and sugar, and outrageous prices reminded her
that the terrific drama was still being played beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
the ocean to the diapason of an orchestra thundering
from England to Asia and from Africa to the Arctic.</p>
<p>But already the eternal signs were pointing to the
end. She read the <i>Republican</i> in the morning, the <i>Star</i>
at night. Gradually it became apparent to the girl
that the great conflagration was slowly dying down
beyond the seas; that there was to be no chance of her
returning; that there was to be no need of her services
even if she were already equipped to render any, and
now, certainly, no time for her to learn anything which
might once have admitted her to comradeship in the
gigantic conflict between man and Satan. She was too
late. The world&rsquo;s tragedy was almost over.</p>
<p>With the signing of the armistice, all dreams of
service ended definitely for her.</p>
<p>False news of the suspension of hostilities should
have, in a measure, prepared her. Yet, the ultimately
truthful news that the war was over made her almost
physically ill. For the girl&rsquo;s ardent religious fervour
had consumed her emotional energy during the incessant
excitement of the past three years. But now, for this
natural ardour, there was no further employment.
There was no outlet for mind or heart so lately on fire
with spiritual fervour. God was no more; her friend
was dead. And now the war had ended. And nobody
in the world had any need of her&ndash;&ndash;any need of this
woman who needed the world&ndash;&ndash;and love&ndash;&ndash;spiritual perhaps,
perhaps profane.</p>
<p>The false peace demonstration, which set the bells
of Shadow Hill clanging in the wintry air and the mill
whistles blowing from distant villages, left her tired,
dazed, indifferent. The later celebration, based on
official news, stirred her spiritually even less. And she
felt ill.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>There was a noisy night celebration on Main Street,
but she had no desire to see it. She remained indoors
reading the <i>Star</i> in the sitting room with Max, the cat.
She ate no dinner. She cried herself to sleep.</p>
<p>However, now that the worst had come&ndash;&ndash;as she
na&iuml;vely informed the shocked Martha next morning&ndash;&ndash;she
began to feel relieved in a restless, feverish way.</p>
<p>A healthful girl accumulates much bodily energy over
night; Palla&rsquo;s passionate little heart and her active
mind completed a storage battery very quickly charged&ndash;&ndash;and
very soon over-charged&ndash;&ndash;and an outlet was imperative.</p>
<p>Always, so far in her brief career, she had had adequate
outlets. As a child she found satisfaction in violent
exercises; in flinging herself headlong into every
outdoor game, every diversion among the urchins of
her circle. As a school girl her school sports and her
studies, and whatever social pleasures were offered, had
left the safety valve open.</p>
<p>Later, mistress of her mother&rsquo;s modest fortune, and
grown to restless, intelligent womanhood, Palla had gone
abroad with a married school-friend, Leila Vance.
Under her auspices she had met nice people and had
seen charming homes in England&ndash;&ndash;Colonel Vance
being somebody in the county and even somebody in
London&ndash;&ndash;a diffident, reticent, agriculturally inclined
land owner and colonel of yeomanry. And long ago
dead in Flanders. And his wife a nurse somewhere in
France.</p>
<p>But before the war a year&rsquo;s travel and study had
furnished the necessary outlet to Palla Dumont. And
then&ndash;&ndash;at a charity bazaar&ndash;&ndash;a passionate friendship had
flashed into sacred flame&ndash;&ndash;a friendship born at sight
between her and the little Grand Duchess Marie.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>War was beginning; Colonel Vance was dead; but
imperial inquiry located Leila. And imperial inquiry
was satisfied. And Palla became the American companion
and friend of the youthful Grand Duchess Marie.
For three years that blind devotion had been her outlet&ndash;&ndash;that
and their mutual inclination for a life to be
dedicated to God.</p>
<p>What was to be her outlet now?&ndash;&ndash;now that the little
Grand Duchess was dead&ndash;&ndash;now that God, as she had
conceived him, had ceased to exist for her&ndash;&ndash;now that
the war was ended, and nobody needed that warm young
heart of hers&ndash;&ndash;that ardent little heart so easily set
throbbing with the passionate desire to give.</p>
<p>The wintry sunlight flooded the familiar sitting room,
setting potted geraniums ablaze, gilding the leather
backs of old books, staining prisms on the crystal chandelier
with rainbow tints, and causing Max, the family
cat, to blink until the vertical pupils of his amber eyes
seemed to disappear entirely.</p>
<p>There was some snow outside&ndash;&ndash;not very much&ndash;&ndash;a
wild bird or two among the naked apple trees; green
edges, still, where snowy lawn and flower border met.</p>
<p>And there was colour in the leafless shrubbery, too&ndash;&ndash;wine-red
stems of dogwood, ash-blue berry-canes, and
the tangled green and gold of willows. And over all a
pale cobalt sky, and a snow-covered hill, where, in the
woods, crows sat cawing on the taller trees, and a slow
goshawk sailed.</p>
<p>A rich land, this, even under ice and snow&ndash;&ndash;a rich,
rolling land hinting of fat furrows and heavy grain;
and of spicy, old-time gardens where the evenings were
heavy with the scent of phlox and lilies.</p>
<p>Palla, her hands behind her back, seeming very childish
and slim in her black gown, stood searching absently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
among the books for something to distract her&ndash;&ndash;something
in harmony with the restless glow of hidden fires
hot in her restless heart.</p>
<p>But war is too completely the great destroyer, killing
even the serener pleasures of the mind, corrupting normal
appetite, dulling all interest except in what pertains
to war.</p>
<p>War is the great vandal, too, obliterating even that
interest in the classic past which is born of respect
for tradition. War slays all yesterdays, so that human
interest lives only in the fierce and present moment, or
blazes anew at thought of what may be to-morrow.</p>
<p>Only the chronicles of the burning hour can hold
human attention where war is. For last week is already
a decade ago; and last year a dead century; but to-day
is vital and to-morrow is immortal.</p>
<p>It was so with Palla. Her listless eyes swept the
ranks of handsome, old-time books&ndash;&ndash;old favourites
bound in gold and leather, masters of English prose and
poetry gathered and garnered by her grand-parents
when books were rare in Shadow Hill.</p>
<p>Not even the modern masters appealed to her&ndash;&ndash;masters
of fiction acclaimed but yesterday; virile
thinkers in philosophy, in science; enfranchised poets
who had stridden out upon Olympus only yesterday
to defy the old god&rsquo;s lightning with unshackled strophes&ndash;&ndash;and
sometimes unbuttoned themes.</p>
<p>But it was with Palla as with others; she drifted
back to the morning paper, wherein lay the interest
of the hour. And nothing else interested her or the
world.</p>
<p>Martha announced lunch. Max accompanied her
on her retreat to the kitchen. Palla loitered, not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
hungry, nervous and unquiet under the increasing
need of occupation for that hot heart of hers.</p>
<p>After a while she went out to the dining room, ate
enough, endured Martha to the verge, and retreated
to await the evening paper.</p>
<p>Her attorney, Mr. Tiddley, came at three. They
discussed quit-claims, mortgages, deeds, surveys, and
reported encroachments incident to the decay of ancient
landmarks. And the conversation maddened her.</p>
<p>At four she put on a smart mourning hat and her
black furs, and walked down to see the bank president,
Mr. Pawling. The subject of their conversation was
investments; and it bored her. At five she returned
to the house to receive a certain Mr. Skidder&ndash;&ndash;known
in her childhood as Blinky Skidder, in frank recognition
of an ocular peculiarity&ndash;&ndash;a dingy but jaunty
young man with a sheep&rsquo;s nose, a shrewd upper lip,
and snapping red-brown eyes, who came breezily in
and said: &ldquo;Hello, Palla! How&rsquo;s the girl?&rdquo; And took
off his faded mackinaw uninvited.</p>
<p>Mr. Skidder&rsquo;s business had once been the exploitation
of farmers and acreage; his specialty the persuasion
of Slovak emigrants into the acquisition of doubtful
land. But since the war, emigrants were few;
and, as honest men must live, Mr. Skidder had branched
out into improved real estate and city lots. But the
pickings, even here, were scanty, and loans hard to
obtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind,&rdquo; said Palla. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
going to sell this house, Blinky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for heaven&rsquo;s sake&ndash;&ndash;ain&rsquo;t you going to New
York?&rdquo; he insisted, taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. But I&rsquo;ve decided to keep my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mr. Skidder, snapping his eyes, &ldquo;is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
silly sentiment, not business. But please yourself
Palla. I ain&rsquo;t saying a word. I ain&rsquo;t trying to tell
you I can get a lot more for you than your house
is worth&ndash;&ndash;what with values falling and houses empty
and the mills letting men go because there ain&rsquo;t going
to be any more war orders!&ndash;&ndash;but please yourself, Palla.
I ain&rsquo;t saying a word to urge you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said several,&rdquo; she remarked, smilingly.
&ldquo;But I think I&rsquo;ll keep the house for the present, and
I&rsquo;m sorry that I wasted your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please yourself, Palla,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I guess
you can afford to from all I hear. I guess you can
do as you&rsquo;ve a mind to, now.... So you&rsquo;re
fixing to locate in New York, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live in a flat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do in New York?&rdquo; he
asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;ll be plenty to do,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; he said, blinking rapidly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
always something doing in that little old town.&rdquo; He
slapped his knee: &ldquo;Palla,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of
going into the movie business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m considering it. Slovaks and bum farms
are played out. There&rsquo;s no money in Shadow Hill&ndash;&ndash;or
if there is, it&rsquo;s locked up&ndash;&ndash;or the income tax has
paralysed it. No, I&rsquo;m through. There&rsquo;s nothing
doing in land; no commissions. And I&rsquo;m considering
a quick getaway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you expect to go?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Palla, when you kiss your old home good-bye,
there&rsquo;s only one place to go. Get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York?&rdquo; she inquired, amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me! There&rsquo;s a guy down there I used to
correspond with&ndash;&ndash;a feller named Puma&ndash;&ndash;Angelo Puma&ndash;&ndash;not
a regular wop, as you might say, but there&rsquo;s
some wop in him, judging by his map&ndash;&ndash;or Mex&ndash;&ndash;or
kike, maybe&ndash;&ndash;or something. Anyway, he&rsquo;s in the moving
picture business&ndash;&ndash;The Ultra-Fillum Company. I
guess there&rsquo;s a mint o&rsquo; money in fillums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, a trifle bored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a chance to go in with Angelo Puma,&rdquo; he
said, snapping his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Palla, I&rsquo;ve made a little money, too,
since you been over there living with the Queen of
Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad, Blinky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it ain&rsquo;t much. And,&rdquo; he added shrewdly, &ldquo;it
ain&rsquo;t so paltry, neither. Thank the Lord, I made
hay while the Slovaks lasted.... So,&rdquo; he
added, getting up from his chair, &ldquo;maybe I&rsquo;ll see you
down there in New York, some day&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated, his blinking eyes redly intent on her
as she rose to her slim height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever thought of the movies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an investment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;that, too. There&rsquo;s big money in it. But
I meant&ndash;&ndash;I mean&ndash;&ndash;it strikes me you&rsquo;d make a bird of
a movie queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion mildly amused her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Grab it from me, Palla,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
you&rsquo;ve got the shape, and you got the looks and you
got the walk and the ways and the education. You
got something peculiar&ndash;&ndash;like you had been born a
rich swell&ndash;&ndash;I mean you kinda naturally act that way&ndash;&ndash;kinda
cocksure of yourself. Maybe you got it living
with that Queen&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think because I&rsquo;ve seen a queen I ought
to know how to act like a movie queen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, picking up his hat, &ldquo;maybe if I
go in with Angelo Puma some day I&rsquo;ll see you again
and we&rsquo;ll talk it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook hands with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be good,&rdquo; he called back as she closed the front
door behind him.</p>
<p>The early winter night had fallen over Shadow
Hill. Palla turned on the electric light, stood for
a while looking sombrely at the framed photographs
of her father and mother, then, feeling lonely, went
into the kitchen where Martha was busy with preparations
for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for the land&rsquo;s sake&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;m going day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth makes you act like a gypsy, Palla?&rdquo;
she demanded querulously, seasoning the soup and
tasting it. &ldquo;Your pa and ma wasn&rsquo;t like that. They
was satisfied to set and rest a mite after being away.
But you&rsquo;ve been gone four years &rsquo;n more, and now
you&rsquo;re up and off again, hippity-skip! clippity-clip!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to run down to New York and look
about. I want to look around and see what&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>you</i>, Palla! That&rsquo;s what you allus was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
doing as a child&ndash;&ndash;allus looking about you with your
wide brown eyes, to see what you could see in the
world!... You know what curiosity did to the
cat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pinched her paw in the mouse-trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; said the girl, laughing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>In touch with his unexciting business again, after
many months of glorious absence, and seated once
more at his abhorred yellow-oak desk, young Shotwell
discovered it was anything except agreeable for
him to gather up the ravelled thrums of civilian life
after the thrilling taste of service over seas.</p>
<p>For him, so long accustomed to excitement, the zest
of living seemed to die with the signing of the armistice.</p>
<p>In fact, since the Argonne drive, all luck seemed
to have deserted him; for in the very middle of operations
he had been sent back to the United States as
instructor; and there the armistice had now caught
him. Furthermore, then, before he realised what
dreadful thing was happening to him, he had been
politely assigned to that vague limbo supposedly inhabited
by a mythical organisation known as The Officers&rsquo;
Reserve Corps, and had been given indefinite leave
of absence preliminary to being mustered out of the
service of the United States.</p>
<p>To part from his uniform was agonising, and he
berated the fate that pried him loose from tunic and
puttees. So disgusted was he that, although the Government
allowed three months longer before discarding
uniforms, he shed his in disgust for &ldquo;cits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But James Shotwell, Jr., was not the only man bewildered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
and annoyed by the rapidity of events which
followed the first days of demobilisation. Half a
dozen other young fellows in the big real estate offices
of Clarence Sharrow &amp; Co. found themselves yanked
out of uniform and seated once more at their familiar,
uninviting desks of yellow oak&ndash;&ndash;very young men,
mostly, assigned to various camps of special three-month
instruction; and now cruelly interrupted while
scrambling frantically after commissions in machine-gun
companies, field artillery, flying units, and tank
corps.</p>
<p>And there they were, back again at the old grind
before they could realise their horrid predicament&ndash;&ndash;the
majority already glum and restless under the
reaction, and hating Shotwell, who, among them all,
had been the only man to cross the sea.</p>
<p>This war-worn and envied veteran of a few months,
perfectly aware that his military career had ended,
was now trying to accept the situation and habituate
himself to the loathly technique of commerce.</p>
<p>Out of uniform, out of humour, out of touch with
the arts of peace; still, at times, all a-quiver with
the nervous shock of his experience, it was very hard
for him to speak respectfully to Mr. Sharrow.</p>
<p>As instructor to rookie aspirants he would have been
somebody: he had already been somebody as a lieutenant
of infantry in the thunderous scheme of things
in the Argonne.</p>
<p>But in the offices of Clarence Sharrow &amp; Co. he
was merely a rather nice-looking civilian subordinate,
whose duties were to aid clients in the selection and
purchase of residences, advise them, consult with them,
make appointments to show them dwelling houses,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
vacant or still tenanted, and in every stage of repair
or decrepitude.</p>
<p>On the wall beside his desk hung a tinted map of
the metropolis. Upon a table at his elbow were piled
ponderous tomes depicting the Bronx in all its beauty,
and giving details of suburban sewers. Other volumes
contained maps of the fashionable residential district,
showing every consecrated block and the exact location
as well as the linear dimensions of every awesome
residence and back yard from Washington Square to
Yorkville.</p>
<p>By referring to a note-book which he carried in his
breast pocket, young Shotwell could inform any grand
lady or any pompous or fussy gentleman what was
the &ldquo;asking price&rdquo; of any particular residence marked
for sale upon the diagrams of the ponderous tomes.</p>
<p>Also&ndash;&ndash;which is why Sharrow selected him for that
particular job&ndash;&ndash;clients liked his good manners and
his engaging ways.</p>
<p>The average client buys a freshly painted house in
preference to a well-built one, but otherwise clamours
always for a bargain. The richer the client the louder
the clamour. And to such demands Shotwell was always
sympathetic&ndash;&ndash;always willing to inquire whether or not
the outrageous price asked for a dwelling might possibly
be &ldquo;shaded&rdquo; a little.</p>
<p>It always could be shaded; but few clients knew
that; and the majority, much flattered at their own
business acumen, entertained kind feelings toward
Sharrow &amp; Co. and sentiments almost cordial toward
young Shotwell when the &ldquo;shading&rdquo; process had
proved to be successful.</p>
<p>But the black-eye dealt the residential district long
ago had not yet cleared up. Real property of that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
sort was still dull and inactive except for a flare-up
now and then along Park Avenue and Fifth.</p>
<p>War, naturally, had not improved matters; and, as
far as the residential part of their business was concerned,
Sharrow &amp; Co. transacted the bulk of it in
leasing apartments and, now and then, a private house,
usually on the West Side.</p>
<p>That morning, in the offices of Sharrow &amp; Co., a
few clients sat beside the desks of the various men
who specialised in the particular brand of real estate
desired: several neat young girls performed diligently
upon typewriters; old man Sharrow stood at the door
of his private office twirling his eyeglasses by the gold
chain and urbanely getting rid of an undesirable visitor&ndash;&ndash;one
Angelo Puma, who wanted some land for a
moving picture studio, but was persuasively unwilling
to pay for it.</p>
<p>He was a big man, too heavy, youngish, with plump
olive skin, black hair, lips too full and too red under
a silky moustache, and eyes that would have been magnificent
in a woman&ndash;&ndash;a Spanish dancer, for example&ndash;&ndash;rich,
dark eyes, softly brilliant under curling lashes.</p>
<p>He seemed to covet the land and the ramshackle
stables on it, but he wanted somebody to take back
a staggering mortgage on the property. And Mr.
Sharrow shook his head gently, and twirled his eyeglasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me,&rdquo; insisted Puma, &ldquo;I do not care. It is
good property. I would pay cash if I had it. But I
have not. No. My capital at the moment is tied
up in production; my daily expenses, at present, require
what cash I have. If your client is at all reasonable&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sharrow. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Connecticut
Yankee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Angelo Puma seemed crestfallen, then
his brilliant smile flashed from every perfect tooth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very bad for me,&rdquo; he said, buttoning-his
showy overcoat. &ldquo;Pardon me; I waste your time&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
pulling on his gloves. &ldquo;However, if your client should
ever care to change his mind&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said Sharrow, whose time Mr. Puma
had indeed wasted at intervals during the past year,
and who heartily desired to be rid of property and
client: &ldquo;Suppose you deal directly with the owner.
We are not particularly anxious to carry the property;
it&rsquo;s a little out of our sphere. Suppose I put
you in direct communication with the owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; said Puma, flashing his smile and bowing
from the waist; and perfectly aware that his
badgering had bored this gentleman to the limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write out his address for you,&rdquo; said Sharrow,
&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;one moment, please&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelo Puma waited, his glossy hat in one hand,
his silver-headed stick and folded suede gloves in the
other.</p>
<p>Like darkly brilliant searchlights his magnificent
eyes swept the offices of Sharrow &amp; Co.; at a glance
he appraised the self-conscious typists, surmised possibilities
in a blond one; then, as a woman entered from
the street, he rested his gaze upon her. And he kept it
there.</p>
<p>Even when Sharrow came out of his private office
with the slip of paper, Angelo Puma&rsquo;s eyes still remained
fastened upon the young girl who had spoken
to a clerk and then seated herself in a chair beside the
desk of James Shotwell, Jr.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; repeated Sharrow patiently, &ldquo;is
Elmer Skidder. His address is Shadow Hill, Connecticut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma turned to him as though confused, thanked
him effusively, took the slip of paper, pulled on his
gloves in a preoccupied way, and very slowly walked
toward the street door, his eyes fixed on the girl who
was now in animated conversation with young Shotwell.</p>
<p>As he passed her she was laughing at something
the young man had just said, and Puma deliberately
turned and looked at her again&ndash;&ndash;looked her full in
the face.</p>
<p>She was aware of him and of his bold scrutiny, of
course&ndash;&ndash;noticed his brilliant eyes, no doubt&ndash;&ndash;but paid
no heed to him&ndash;&ndash;was otherwise preoccupied with this
young man beside her, whom she had neither seen nor
thought about since the day she had landed in New
York from the rusty little Danish steamer <i>Elsinore</i>.</p>
<p>And now, although he had meant nothing at all to
her except an episode already forgotten, to meet him
again had instantly meant something to her.</p>
<p>For this man now represented to her a link with the
exciting past&ndash;&ndash;this young soldier who had been fresh
from the furnace when she had met him on deck as
the <i>Elsinore</i> passed in between the forts in the grey
of early morning.</p>
<p>The encounter was exciting her a little, too, over-emphasising
its importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;my encountering you here
and in civilian dress! Were you dreadfully disappointed
by the armistice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to say I took it hard,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I. I had hoped so to go to France. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
you&ndash;&ndash;oh, I <i>am</i> sorry for you. You were so disgusted
at being detailed from the fighting line to Camp
Upton! And now the war is over. What a void!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very frank,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to
rejoice, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. I really do rejoice&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;In my sober senses I
am glad the war is over. I&rsquo;d be a monster if I were
not glad. But&ndash;&ndash;<i>what</i> is going to take its place?
Because we must have something, you know. One
can&rsquo;t endure a perfect void, can one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was such a tremendous thing,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I did want to be part of it before it ended. But of
course peace is a tremendous thing, too&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they both laughed once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody overhearing us,&rdquo; she confided to him,
&ldquo;would think us mere beasts. Of course you are glad
the war is ended: that&rsquo;s why you fought. And I&rsquo;m
glad, too. And I&rsquo;m going to rent a house in New
York and find something to occupy this void I speak
of. But isn&rsquo;t it nice that I should come to you about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jolly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And now at last I&rsquo;m going to
learn your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Don&rsquo;t you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to ask you, but there seemed to be no
proper opportunity&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I remember. There seemed to be no
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry afterward,&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
<p>That amused her. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t really sorry, were
you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I really was. I thought of you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you remembered me after the
ship docked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I&rsquo;m very sure you instantly forgot me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did!&rdquo; she admitted, still much amused
at the idea. &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t remember everybody one
sees, you know,&rdquo; she went on frankly,&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;particularly
after a horrid voyage and when one&rsquo;s head is full of
exciting plans. Alas! those wonderful plans of mine!&ndash;&ndash;the
stuff that dreams are made of. And here I
am asking you kindly to find me a modest house with
a modest rental.... And by the way,&rdquo; she
added demurely, &ldquo;my name is Palla Dumont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said smilingly. &ldquo;Do you care to
know mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. When I came in and told the clerk
what I wanted, he said I should see Mr. Shotwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;James Shotwell, Jr.,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>is</i> amiable. You don&rsquo;t treasure malice, do
you? I might merely have known you as <i>Mr.</i> Shotwell.
And you generously reveal all from James to Junior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were laughing again. Mr. Sharrow noticed
them from his private office and congratulated himself
on having Shotwell in his employment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When may I see a house?&rdquo; inquired Palla, settling
her black-gloved hands in her black fox muff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out his note-book, glanced through several
pages, asked her carelessly what rent she cared to pay,
made a note of it, and resumed his study of the note-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The East Side?&rdquo; he inquired, glancing at her with
curiosity not entirely professional.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his note-book he read to her the descriptions
and situations of several twenty-foot houses in the
zone between Fifth and Third Avenues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go to see some of them, Mr. Shotwell?
Have you, perhaps, time this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted,&rdquo; he said. Which, far from straining
truth, perhaps restrained it.</p>
<p>So he got his hat and overcoat, and they went out
together into the winter sunshine.</p>
<p>Angelo Puma, seated in a taxi across the street,
observed them. He wore a gardenia in his lapel. He
might have followed Palla had she emerged alone from
the offices of Sharrow &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Shotwell Junior had a jolly morning of it. And,
if the routine proved a trifle monotonous, Palla, too,
appeared to amuse herself.</p>
<p>She inspected various types of houses, expensive
and inexpensive, modern and out of date, well built
and well kept and &ldquo;jerry-built&rdquo; and dirty.</p>
<p>Prices and rents painfully surprised her, and she
gave up any idea of renting a furnished house, and
so informed Shotwell.</p>
<p>So they restricted their inspection to three-story
unfurnished and untenanted houses, where the neighbourhood
was less pretentious and there was a better
light in the rear.</p>
<p>But they all were dirty, neglected, out of repair,
destitute of decent plumbing and electricity.</p>
<p>On the second floor of one of these Palla stood,
discouraged, perplexed, gazing absently out, across a
filthy back yard full of seedling ailanthus trees and
rubbish, at the rear fire escapes on the tenements
beyond.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>Shotwell, exploring the closely written pages of his
note-book, could discover nothing desirable within the
terms she was willing to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one house on our books,&rdquo; he said at last,
&ldquo;which came in only yesterday. I haven&rsquo;t had time to
look at it. I don&rsquo;t even know where the keys are.
But if you&rsquo;re not too tired&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla gave him one of her characteristic direct looks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too tired, but I&rsquo;m starved. I could go
after lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry, too! Shall we go
to Delmonico&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl seemed a trifle nonplussed. She had not
supposed that luncheon with clients was included in
a real estate transaction.</p>
<p>She was not embarrassed, nor did the suggestion
seem impertinent. But she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had expected to lunch at the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reddened a little. Guilt shows its colors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you rather?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. I&rsquo;d rather lunch with you at Delmonico&rsquo;s
and talk houses.&rdquo; And, a little amused at this young
man&rsquo;s transparent guile, she added: &ldquo;I think it would
be very agreeable for us to lunch together.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She came from the dressing-room fresh and flushed
as a slightly chilled rose, rejoining him in the lobby,
and presently they were seated in the palm room with
a discreet and hidden orchestra playing, &ldquo;Oh! How I
Hate To Get Up in the Morning,&rdquo; and rather busy
with a golden Casaba melon between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this jolly!&rdquo; he said, expanding easily, as do
all young men in the warmth of the informal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Very. What an agreeable business yours seems
to be, Mr. Shotwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; he asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, part of it is lunching with feminine clients,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His close-set ears burned. She glanced up with
mischief brilliant in her brown eyes. But he was busy
with his melon. And, not looking at her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know me?&rdquo; he asked so clumsily
that she hesitated to snub so defenceless a male.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I wish to,&rdquo; she replied, smiling
slightly. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t aspired to it; I hadn&rsquo;t really considered
it. I was thinking about renting a house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said nothing, but, as the painful colour remained
in his face, the girl decided to be a little kinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m enjoying myself. And I
hope you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he was. But his voice and manner were so
subdued that she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy asking a girl such a question,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t ask a woman whether she doesn&rsquo;t want
to know you. It would be irregular enough, under
the circumstances, to say that you wanted to know
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I meant,&rdquo; he replied, wincing. &ldquo;Would
you consider it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not disguise her amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll consider it, Mr. Shotwell. I&rsquo;ll give it my
careful attention. I owe you something, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked uncertainly, prepared for further
squelching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly what. But when a man remembers
a woman, and the woman forgets the man,
isn&rsquo;t something due him?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think there is,&rdquo; he said so na&iuml;vely that Palla was
unable to restrain her gaiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a silly conversation,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;as silly
as though I had accepted the cocktail you so thoughtfully
suggested. We&rsquo;re both enjoying each other and
we know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; he exclaimed, brightening.</p>
<p>His boyish relief&ndash;&ndash;everything that this young man
said to her&ndash;&ndash;seemed to excite the girl to mirth. Perhaps
she had been starved for laughter longer than
is good for anybody. Besides, her heart was naturally
responsive&ndash;&ndash;opened easily&ndash;&ndash;was easily engaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m inclined to like you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or
I wouldn&rsquo;t be here lunching with you and talking nonsense
instead of houses&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk houses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we&rsquo;ll <i>look</i> at them&ndash;&ndash;later.... Do you
know it&rsquo;s a long, long time since I have laughed with
a really untroubled heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it isn&rsquo;t good for a girl. Sadness is a sickness&ndash;&ndash;a
physical disorganisation that infects the mind.
It makes a strange emotion of love, too, perverting
it to that mysticism we call religion&ndash;&ndash;and wasting it....
I suppose you&rsquo;re rather shocked,&rdquo; she said
smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.... But have you no religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protestant.... Are you Catholic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rested her cheek on her hand and dabbed
absently at her orange ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was once,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was very religious&ndash;&ndash;in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
the accepted sense of the term.... It came rather
suddenly;&ndash;&ndash;it seemed to be born as part of a sudden
and close friendship with a girl&ndash;&ndash;began with that friendship,
I think.... And died with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat quite silent for a while, then a tremulous
smile edged her lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had meant to take the veil,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did
begin my novitiate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, in Russia. There are a few foreign cloistered
orders there.... But I had a tragic awakening....&rdquo;
She bent her head and quoted softly, &ldquo;&lsquo;For the former
things have passed away.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orange ice was melting; she stirred it idly,
watching it dissolve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I had utterly misunderstood the
scheme of things. Divinity is not a sad, a solemn,
a solitary autocrat demanding selfish tribute, blind
allegiance, inexorable self-abasement. It is not an insecure
tyrant offering bribery for the cringing, frightened
servitude demanded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up smilingly at the man: &ldquo;Nor, within us,
is there any soul in the accepted meaning,&ndash;&ndash;no satellite
released at death to revolve around or merge into
some super-divinity. No!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I believe,&ndash;&ndash;I <i>know</i>&ndash;&ndash;that the body&ndash;&ndash;every one&rsquo;s
body&ndash;&ndash;is inhabited by a complete god, immortal, retaining
its divine entity, beholden to no other deity save
only itself, and destined to encounter in a divine democracy
and through endless futures, unnumbered brother
gods&ndash;&ndash;the countless divinities which have possessed and
shall possess those tenements of mankind which we call
our bodies.... You do not, of course, subscribe to
such a faith,&rdquo; she added, meeting his gaze.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He hesitated. She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Autocracy in heaven is as unthinkable, as unbelievable,
and as obnoxious to me as is autocracy on earth.
There is no such thing as divine right, here or elsewhere,&ndash;&ndash;no
divine prerogatives for tyranny, for punishment,
for cruelty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to embrace such a faith?&rdquo; he
asked, bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sick of the scheme of things. Suffering,
cruelty, death outraged my common sense. It is not in
me to say, &lsquo;Thy will be done,&rsquo; to any autocrat, heavenly
or earthly. It is not in me to fawn on the hand that
strikes me&ndash;&ndash;or that strikes any helpless thing! No!
And the scheme of things sickened me, and I nearly
died of it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clenched her hand where it rested on the table,
and he saw her face flushed and altered by the fire
within. Then she smiled and leaned back in her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In you,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;dwells a god. In me a
goddess,&ndash;&ndash;a joyous one,&ndash;&ndash;a divine thing that laughs,&ndash;&ndash;a
complete and free divinity that is gay and tender,
that is incapable of tyranny, that loves all things both,
great and small, that exists to serve&ndash;&ndash;freely, not for reward&ndash;&ndash;that
owes allegiance and obedience only to the
divine and eternal law within its own godhead. And
that law is the law of love.... And that is my
substitute for the scheme of things. Could you subscribe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a silence he quoted: &ldquo;<i>Could you and I with
Him conspire</i>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded: &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>To grasp this sorry scheme of things
entire</i>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; But there is no &lsquo;<i>Him</i>.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s you and I....
Both divine.... Suppose we grasp it
and &lsquo;<i>shatter it to bits</i>.&rsquo; Shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>And then remould it nearer to the heart&rsquo;s desire?</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remould it nearer to the logic of common sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither spoke for a few moments. Then she drew
a swift, smiling breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting on rather rapidly, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Did you expect to lunch with such a friendly,
human girl? And will you now take her to inspect this
modest house which you hope may suit her, and which,
she most devoutly hopes may suit her, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been a perfectly delightful day,&rdquo; he said
as they rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to corroborate you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a wonderful time,&rdquo; she said lightly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>John Estridge, out of a job&ndash;&ndash;as were a million
odd others now arriving from France by every
transport&ndash;&ndash;met James Shotwell, Junior, one wintry
day as the latter was leaving the real estate offices
of Sharrow &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; exclaimed Estridge; &ldquo;I supposed you, at
least, were safe in the service, Jim! Isn&rsquo;t your regiment
in Germany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Shotwell wrathfully, shaking hands.
&ldquo;Where do you come from, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From hell&ndash;&ndash;via Copenhagen. In milder but misleading
metaphor, I come from Holy Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the Red Cross fire you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but they told me to run along home like a
good boy and get my degree. I&rsquo;m not an M.D., you
know. And there&rsquo;s a shortage. So I had to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here; I had to come.&rdquo; And Shotwell, for
Estridge&rsquo;s enlightenment, held a post-mortem over the
premature decease of his promising military career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; commented the latter. &ldquo;It sure was exciting
while it lasted&ndash;&ndash;our mixing it in the great game.
There&rsquo;s pandemonium to pay in Russia, now;&ndash;&ndash;I rather
hated to leave.... But it was either leave or be
shot up. The Bolsheviki are impossible.... Are
you walking up town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They fell into step together.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go back to the P. &amp; S., I suppose,&rdquo; ventured
Shotwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m already nailed down to the old oaken desk.
Sharrow&rsquo;s my boss, if you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must seem dull,&rdquo; said Estridge sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rotten dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean business too, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s also on the bum.... I did contrive
to sell a small house the other day&ndash;&ndash;and blew myself
to this overcoat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so unusual?&rdquo; asked Estridge, smiling,&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;to
sell a house in town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a miracle in these days. Tell me, Jack,
how did you get on in Russia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many Reds. We couldn&rsquo;t do much. They&rsquo;ve
got it in for everybody except themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The socialists?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the social revolutionists. I&rsquo;m talking about
the Reds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they make the revolution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who are the Reds, and what is it they want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want to set the world on fire. Then they
want to murder and rob everybody with any education.
Then they plan to start things from the stone age
again. They want loot and blood. That&rsquo;s really all
they want. Their object is to annihilate civilisation by
exterminating the civilised. They desire to start all
over from first principles&ndash;&ndash;without possessing any&ndash;&ndash;and
turn the murderous survivors of the human massacre
into one vast, international pack of wolves. And
they&rsquo;re beginning to do it in Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pleasant programme,&rdquo; remarked Shotwell. &ldquo;No
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
wonder you beat it, Jack. I recently met a woman who
had just arrived from Russia. They murdered her best
friend&ndash;&ndash;one of the little Grand Duchesses. She simply
can&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a beastly business,&rdquo; nodded Estridge.
&ldquo;I happen to know a little about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were <i>you</i> in that district?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&ndash;&ndash;not when that thing happened. But some
little time before the Bolsheviki murdered the Imperial
family I had occasion to escort an American girl to
the convent where they were held under detention....
An exceedingly pretty girl,&rdquo; he added absently.
&ldquo;She was once companion to one of the murdered Imperial
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell glanced up quickly: &ldquo;Her name, by any
chance, doesn&rsquo;t happen to be Palla Dumont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sold her that house I was telling you about. Do
you know her well, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge smiled. &ldquo;Yes and no. Perhaps I know her
better than she suspects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell laughed, recollecting his friend&rsquo;s inclination
for analysing character and his belief in his ability to
do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same old scientific vivisectionist!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So
you&rsquo;ve been dissecting Palla Dumont, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. She&rsquo;s a type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A charming one,&rdquo; added Shotwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know her well&ndash;&ndash;outside of having
mentally vivisected her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge laughed: &ldquo;Palla Dumont and I have been
through some rather hair-raising scrapes together. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
I&rsquo;ll admit right now that she possesses all kinds of
courage&ndash;&ndash;perhaps too many kinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has the courage of her convictions and her
convictions, sometimes, don&rsquo;t amount to much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on and cut her up,&rdquo; said Shotwell, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only fault I find with Palla Dumont,&rdquo;
explained the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said she was a type?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is,&ndash;&ndash;the type of unmarried woman who continually
develops too much pep for her brain to properly
take care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you consider Palla Dumont neurotic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Nothing abnormal. Perhaps super-normal&ndash;&ndash;pathologically
speaking. Bodily health is fine. But
over-secretion of ardent energy sometimes disturbs one&rsquo;s
mental equilibrium. The result, in a crisis, is likely
to result in extravagant behavior. Martyrs are made
of such stuff, for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think her a visionary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, her reason and her emotions sometimes become
rather badly entangled, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t everybody&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At intervals. Then the thing to do is to keep perfectly
cool till the fit is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think her impulsive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say so!&rdquo; smiled Estridge. &ldquo;Of course
I mean nicely impulsive&ndash;&ndash;even nobly impulsive....
But that won&rsquo;t help her. Impulse never helped anybody.
It&rsquo;s a spoke in the wheel&ndash;&ndash;a stumbling block&ndash;&ndash;a
stick to trip anybody.... Particularly a girl....
And Palla Dumont mistakes impulse for
logic. She honestly thinks that she reasons.&rdquo; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
smiled to himself: &ldquo;A disturbingly pretty girl,&rdquo; he
murmured, &ldquo;with a tender heart ... which seems
to do all her thinking for her.... How well do
you know her, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not well. But I&rsquo;m going to, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge glanced up interrogatively, suddenly remembering
all the uncontradicted gossip concerning a
tacit understanding between Shotwell, Jr., and Elorn
Sharrow. It is true that no engagement had been announced;
but none had been denied, either. And Miss
Sharrow had inherited her mother&rsquo;s fortune. And Shotwell,
Jr., made only a young man&rsquo;s living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be rather careful with such a girl,&rdquo;
he remarked carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, careful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s rather perilously attractive, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
insisted Estridge smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s extremely interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly is. She&rsquo;s rather an amazing girl in
her way. More amazing than perhaps you imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even astounding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you an example. When the Reds invaded
that convent and seized the Czarina and her children,
Palla Dumont, then a novice of six weeks, attempted
martyrdom by pretending that she herself was the little
Grand Duchess Marie. And when the Reds refused
to believe her, she demanded the privilege of dying
beside her little friend. She even insulted the Reds,
defied them, taunted them until they swore to return
and cut her throat as soon as they finished with the
Imperial family. And then this same Palla Dumont, to
whom you sold a house in New York the other day,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
flew into an ungovernable passion; tried to batter her
way into the cellar; shattered half a dozen chapel
chairs against the oak door of the crypt behind which
preparations for the assassination were taking place;
then, helpless, called on God to interfere and put a
stop to it. And, when deity, as usual, didn&rsquo;t interfere
with the scheme of things, this girl tore the white veil
from her face and the habit from her body and denounced
as nonexistent any alleged deity that permitted
such things to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell gazed at Estridge in blank astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where on earth did you hear all that dope?&rdquo; he
demanded incredulously.</p>
<p>Estridge smiled: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all quite true, Jim. And
Palla Dumont escaped having her slender throat slit
open only because a sotnia of Kaladines&rsquo; Cossacks cantered
up, discovered what the Reds were up to in the
cellar, and beat it with Palla and another girl just in
the nick of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who handed you this cinema stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The other girl.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can judge for yourself. This other girl was a
young Swedish soldier who had served in the Battalion
of Death. It&rsquo;s really cinema stuff, as you say. But
Russia, to-day, is just one hell after another in an
endless and bloody drama. Such picturesque incidents,&ndash;&ndash;the
wildest episodes, the craziest coincidences&ndash;&ndash;are
occurring by thousands every day of the year in Russia....
And, Jim, it was due to one of those daily
and crazy coincidences that my sleigh, in which I was
beating it for Helsingfors, was held up by that same
sotnia of the Wild Division on a bitter day, near the
borders of a pine forest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s where I encountered Palla Dumont again.
And that&rsquo;s where I heard&ndash;&ndash;not from her, but from her
soldier comrade, Ilse Westgard&ndash;&ndash;the story I have just
told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while they continued to walk up and down
in silence.</p>
<p>Finally Estridge said: &ldquo;<i>There</i> was a girl for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla Dumont!&rdquo; nodded Shotwell, still too astonished
to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the other.... An amazing girl....
Nearly six feet; physically perfect;&ndash;&ndash;what the human
girl ought to be and seldom is;&ndash;&ndash;symmetrical, flawless,
healthy&ndash;&ndash;a super-girl ... like some young
daughter of the northern gods!... Ilse Westgard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of those women soldiers, you say?&rdquo; inquired
Shotwell, mildly curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There were all kinds of women in that Death
Battalion. We saw them,&ndash;&ndash;your friend Palla Dumont
and I,&ndash;&ndash;saw them halted and standing at ease in a
birch wood; saw them marching into fire....
And there were all sorts of women, Jim; peasant,
bourgeoise and aristocrat;&ndash;&ndash;there were dressmakers,
telephone operators, servant-girls, students, Red Cross
nurses, actresses from the Marinsky, Jewesses from the
Pale, sisters of the Yellow Ticket, Japanese girls,
Chinese, Cossack, English, Finnish, French....
And they went over the top cheering for Russia!...
They went over to shame the army which had
begun to run from the hun.... Pretty fine,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!... After this war&ndash;&ndash;after what
women have done the world over&ndash;&ndash;I wonder whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
there are any asses left who desire to restrict woman
to a &lsquo;sphere&rsquo;?... I&rsquo;d like to see Ilse Westgard
again,&rdquo; he added absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she a peasant girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. A daughter of well-to-do people. Quite the
better sort, I should say. And she was more thoroughly
educated than the average girl of our own sort....
A brave and cheerful soldier in the Battalion of Death....
Ilse Westgard.... Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another brief silence Shotwell ventured: &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;d find it agreeable to meet Palla Dumont
again, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, of course,&rdquo; replied the other pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you like, she&rsquo;ll ask us to tea some day&ndash;&ndash;after
her new house is in shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be very sure about what Palla Dumont
is likely to do,&rdquo; said Estridge, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; retorted Shotwell, with emphasis.
&ldquo;Palla Dumont has a mind of her own,&ndash;&ndash;although you
don&rsquo;t seem to think so,&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she has a <i>will</i> of her own,&rdquo; interrupted the
other, amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you concede her <i>some</i> mental attribute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do indeed! I never intimated that she is weak-willed.
She isn&rsquo;t. Other and stronger wills don&rsquo;t
dominate hers. Perhaps it would be better if they did
sometimes....</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no; Palla Dumont arrives headlong at her own
red-hot decisions. It is not the will of others that influences
her; it is their indecision, their lack of willpower,
their very weakness that seems to stimulate and
vitally influence such a character as Palla Dumont&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;Such a <i>character</i>?&rdquo; repeated Shotwell. &ldquo;What
sort of character do you suppose hers to be, anyway?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
Between you and your psychological and pathological
surmises you don&rsquo;t seem to leave her any character at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you,&rdquo; said Estridge, &ldquo;that the girl is
influenced not by the will or desire of others, but by
their necessities, their distress, their needs....
Or what she believes to be their needs.... And
you may decide for yourself how valuable are the conclusions
of an impulsive, wilful, fearless, generous girl
whose heart regulates her thinking apparatus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to you, then, she is practically mindless,&rdquo;
remarked Shotwell, ironically. &ldquo;You medically minded
gentlemen are wonders!&ndash;&ndash;all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get me. The girl is clever and intelligent
when her accumulated emotions let her brain
alone. When they interfere, her logic goes to smash
and she does exaggerated things&ndash;&ndash;like trying to sacrifice
herself for her friend in the convent there&ndash;&ndash;like
tearing off the white garments of her novitiate and
denouncing deity!&ndash;&ndash;like embracing an extravagant pantheistic
religion of her own manufacture and proclaiming
that the Law of Love is the only law!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the young lady on the subject, Jim.
And, medically minded or not, I&rsquo;m medically on to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on together in silence for nearly a
whole block; then Estridge said bluntly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be better balanced if she were married and
had a few children. Such types usually are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell made no comment. Presently the other
spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Law of Love! What rot! That&rsquo;s sheer hysteria.
Follow that law and you become a saint, perhaps,
perhaps a devil. Love sacred, love profane&ndash;&ndash;both,
when exaggerated, arise from the same physical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
condition&ndash;&ndash;too much pep for the mind to distribute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens? Exaggerations. Extravagances.
Hallucinations. Mysticisms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What results? Nuns. Hermits. Yogis. Exhorters.
Fanatics. Cranks. <i>Sometimes.</i> For, from the
same chrysalis, Jim, may emerge either a vestal, or
one of those tragic characters who, swayed by this same
remarkable Law of Love, may give ... and burn
on&ndash;&ndash;slowly&ndash;&ndash;from the first lover to the next. And so,
into darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added, smiling: &ldquo;The only law of love subscribed
to by sane people is framed by a balanced brain and
interpreted by common sense. Those who obey any
other code go a-glimmering, saint and sinner, novice
and Magdalene alike.... This is your street, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands cordially.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>After dining <i>en famille</i>, Shotwell Junior considered
the various diversions offered to young business men
after a day of labour.</p>
<p>There were theatres; there was the Club de Vingt
and similar agreeable asylums; there was also a telephone
to ring, and unpremeditated suggestions to make
to friends, either masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>Or he could read and improve his mind. Or go to
Carnegie Hall with his father and mother and listen to
music of sorts.... Or&ndash;&ndash;he could call up Elorn
Sharrow.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t decide; and his parents presently derided
him and departed music-ward without him. He read
an evening paper, discarded it, poked the fire, stood
before it, jingled a few coins and keys in his pocket,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
still undecided, still rather disinclined to any exertion,
even as far as the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what that girl is doing
now. I&rsquo;ve a mind to call her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to know whom he meant by &ldquo;that girl.&rdquo;
Also, it was evident that he did not mean Elorn Sharrow;
for it was not her number he called and presently
got.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dumont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere nobody. It&rsquo;s only your broker&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What!!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your real-estate broker&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Shotwell! How absurd of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why absurd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t think of you merely as a real-estate
broker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you <i>do</i> sometimes think of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What power of deduction! What logic! You seem
to be in a particularly frivolous frame of mind. Are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m in a bad one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I haven&rsquo;t a bally thing to do this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s silly!&ndash;&ndash;with the entire town outside....
I&rsquo;m glad you called me up, anyway. I&rsquo;m tired and
bored and exceedingly cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, Miss Dumont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely and idiotically nothing. I&rsquo;m merely
sitting here on the only chair in this scantily furnished
house, and trying to plan what sort of carpets, draperies
and furniture to buy. Can you imagine the scene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had some things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything! Not even a decent mirror. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
stand on the slippery edge of a bath tub to get a complete
view of myself. And then it&rsquo;s only by sections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tragic. Have you a cook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have. But no dining room table. I eat from a
tray on a packing case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a waitress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a maid. They&rsquo;re comfortable. I bought
their furniture immediately and also the batterie-de-cuisine.
It&rsquo;s only I who slink about like a perplexed
cat, from one empty room to another, in search of
familiar comforts.... But I bought a sofa
to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful sofa. It&rsquo;s here, now. It&rsquo;s an
antique. But I can&rsquo;t make up my mind how to upholster
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care for a suggestion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d have to see it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d say that. Really, Mr. Shotwell,
I&rsquo;d like most awfully to see you, but this place is too
uncomfortable. I told you I&rsquo;d ask you to tea some
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me come down for a few moments this
evening&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;And pay you a formal little call&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.... Would you really like to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t after you got here. There&rsquo;s nothing
for you to sit on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dusty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that antique sofa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not upholstered.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What do I care! May I come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really wish to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As fast as I can get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard her laughing. Then: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be perfectly
delighted to see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was actually thinking
of taking to my bed out of sheer boredom. Are
you coming in a taxi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard her laughing again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;only I thought that
might be the quickest way&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her laughter interrupted
her, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;to bring me the evening papers. I haven&rsquo;t a
thing to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> why you want me to take a taxi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is. News is a necessity to me, and I&rsquo;m famishing....
What other reason could there be for a taxi?
Did you suppose I was in a hurry to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened to her laughter for a moment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a taxi and bring a
book for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And please don&rsquo;t forget my evening papers or I
shall have to requisition your book.... Or possibly
share it with you on the upholstered sofa....
And I read very rapidly and don&rsquo;t like being kept waiting
for slower people to turn the page.... Mr.
Shotwell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a wonderful floor. Could you bring some
roller skates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll bring a music box and we&rsquo;ll
dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not serious&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am. Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do such a thing. My servants would think
me crazy. I&rsquo;m mortally afraid of them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He found a toy-shop on Third Avenue still open,
and purchased a solemn little music-box that played
ting-a-ling tunes.</p>
<p>Then, in his taxi, he veered over to Fifth Avenue and
Forty-second Street, where he bought roses and a
spray of orchids. Then, adding to his purchases a
huge box of bon-bons, he set his course for the three
story and basement house which he had sold to Palla
Dumont.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>Shotwell Senior and his wife were dining
out that evening.</p>
<p>Shotwell Junior had no plans&ndash;&ndash;or admitted
none, even to himself. He got into a bath and later into
a dinner jacket, in an absent-minded way, and finally
sauntered into the library wearing a vague scowl.</p>
<p>The weather had turned colder, and there was an
open fire there, and a convenient armchair and the
evening papers.</p>
<p>Perhaps the young gentleman had read them down
town, for he shoved them aside. Then he dropped an
elbow on the table, rested his chin against his knuckles,
and gazed fiercely at the inoffensive <i>Evening Post</i>.</p>
<p>Before any open fire any young man ought to be
able to make up whatever mind he chances to possess.
Yet, what to do with a winter evening all his own
seemed to him a problem unfathomable.</p>
<p>Perhaps his difficulty lay only in selection&ndash;&ndash;there are
so many agreeable things for a young man to do in
Gotham Town on a winter&rsquo;s evening.</p>
<p>But, oddly enough, young Shotwell was trying to
persuade himself that he had no choice of occupation
for the evening; that he really didn&rsquo;t care. Yet, always
two intrusive alternatives continually presented themselves.
The one was to change his coat for a spike-tail,
his black tie for a white one, and go to the Metropolitan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
Opera. The other and more attractive alternative was
<i>not</i> to go.</p>
<p>Elorn Sharrow would be at the opera. To appear,
now and then, in the Sharrow family&rsquo;s box was expected
of him. He hadn&rsquo;t done it recently.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He dropped one lean leg over the other and gazed
gravely at the fire. He was still trying to convince
himself that he had no particular plan for the evening&ndash;&ndash;that
it was quite likely he might go to the opera
or to the club&ndash;&ndash;or, in fact, almost anywhere his fancy
suggested.</p>
<p>In his effort to believe himself the scowl came back,
denting his eyebrows. Presently he forced a yawn,
unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>Yes, he thought he&rsquo;d better go to the opera, after
all. He ought to go.... It seemed to be rather
expected of him.</p>
<p>Besides, he had nothing else to do&ndash;&ndash;that is, nothing
in particular&ndash;&ndash;unless, of course&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But <i>that</i> would scarcely do. He&rsquo;d been <i>there</i> so
often recently.... No, <i>that</i> wouldn&rsquo;t do....
Besides it was becoming almost a habit with him.
He&rsquo;d been drifting there so frequently of late!...
In fact, he&rsquo;d scarcely been anywhere at all, recently,
except&ndash;&ndash;except where he certainly was not going that
evening. And that settled it!... So he might as
well go to the opera.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>His mother, in scarf and evening wrap, passing the
library door on her way down, paused in the hall and
looked intently at her only son.</p>
<p>Recently she had been observing him rather closely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
and with a vague uneasiness born of that inexplicable
sixth sense inherent in mothers.</p>
<p>Perhaps what her son had faced in France accounted
for the change in him;&ndash;&ndash;for it was being said that
no man could come back from such scenes unchanged;&ndash;&ndash;none
could ever again be the same. And it was
being said, too, that old beliefs and ideals had altered;
that everything familiar was ending;&ndash;&ndash;and that the
former things had already passed away under the
glimmering dawn of a new heaven and a new earth.</p>
<p>Perhaps all this was so&ndash;&ndash;though she doubted it.
Perhaps this son she had borne in agony might become
to her somebody less familiar than the baby she had
nursed at her own breast.</p>
<p>But so far, to her, he continued to remain the same
familiar baby she had always known&ndash;&ndash;the same and
utterly vital part of her soul and body. No sudden
fulfilment of an apocalypse had yet wrought any occult
metamorphosis in this boy of hers.</p>
<p>And if he now seemed changed it was from that simple
and familiar cause instinctively understood by mothers,&ndash;&ndash;trouble!&ndash;&ndash;the
most ancient plague of all and the
only malady which none escapes.</p>
<p>She was a rather startlingly pretty woman, with the
delicate features and colour and the snow-white hair
of an 18th century belle. She stood, now, drawing on
her gloves and watching her son out of dark-fringed
deep blue eyes, until he glanced around uneasily. Then
he rose at once, looking at her with fire-dazzled eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rise, dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the car is here and
your father is fussing and fuming in the drawing-room,
and I&rsquo;ve got to run.... Have you any plans
for the evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dining at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to the opera to-night? It&rsquo;s the
Sharrows&rsquo; night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came toward her irresolutely. &ldquo;Perhaps I shall,&rdquo;
he said. And instantly she knew he did not intend
to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had tea at the Sharrows&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said, carelessly,
still buttoning her gloves. &ldquo;Elorn told me that she
hadn&rsquo;t laid eyes on you for ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened so.... I&rsquo;ve had a lot of things
to do&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and she still agree, don&rsquo;t you, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes&ndash;&ndash;as usual. We always get on together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen Shotwell&rsquo;s ermine wrap slipped; he caught it
and fastened it for her, and she took hold of both his
hands and drew his arms tightly around her pretty
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What troubles you, darling?&rdquo; she asked smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing, mother&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, there is nothing, dear&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me when you are ready, then,&rdquo; she laughed and
released him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t anything,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jim, there is. Do you suppose I don&rsquo;t know
you after all these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She considered him with clear, amused eyes: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
forget,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that I was only seventeen when
you arrived, my son; and I have grown up with you
ever since&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Helen!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; protested Sharrow
Senior plaintively from the front hall below. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
you gossip with Jim some other time?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way, James,&rdquo; she announced calmly.
&ldquo;Put your overcoat on.&rdquo; And, to her son: &ldquo;Go to the
opera. Elorn will cheer you up. Isn&rsquo;t that a good
idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;certainly&ndash;&ndash;an idea.... I&rsquo;ll think
it over.... And, mother, if I seem solemn at
times, please try to remember how rotten every fellow
feels about being out of the service&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gay, derisive laughter checked him, warning him
that he was not imposing on her credulity. She said
smilingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have neglected Elorn Sharrow, and you know
it, and it&rsquo;s on your conscience&ndash;&ndash;whatever else may be
on it, too. And that&rsquo;s partly why you feel blue. So
keep out of mischief, darling, and stop neglecting
Elorn&ndash;&ndash;that is, if you ever really expect to marry
her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you that I have never asked her; and I
never intend to ask her until I am making a decent
living,&rdquo; he said impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there an understanding between you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t think so. There couldn&rsquo;t be. We&rsquo;ve
never spoken of that sort of thing in our lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she expects you to ask her some day.
Everybody else does, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is the one thing I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> do,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;go about with the seat out of my pants and ask
an heiress to sew on the patch for me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling! You <i>can</i> be so common when you try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it amounts to that&ndash;&ndash;doesn&rsquo;t it, mother? I
don&rsquo;t care what busy gossips say or idle people expect
me to do! There&rsquo;s no engagement, no understanding
between Elorn and me. And I don&rsquo;t care a hang what
anybody&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>His mother framed his slightly flushed face between
her gloved hands and inspected him humorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you need not be
so emphatically excited about it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not excited&ndash;&ndash;but it irritates me to be expected
to do anything because it&rsquo;s expected of me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
He shrugged his shoulders:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if I ever should fall in love
with anybody it&rsquo;s my own business. And whatever I
choose to do about it will be my own affair. And I
shall keep my own counsel in any event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother stepped forward, letting both her hands
fall into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you tell me about it, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell you before I&rsquo;d tell anybody else&ndash;&ndash;if it ever
became serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <i>what</i> became serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;anything of that sort,&rdquo; he replied. But a
bright colour stained his features and made him wince
under her intent scrutiny.</p>
<p>She was worried, now, though her pretty, humorous
smile still challenged him with its raillery.</p>
<p>But it was becoming very evident to her that if this
boy of hers were growing sentimental over any woman
the woman was not Elorn Sharrow.</p>
<p>So far she had held her son&rsquo;s confidence. She must
do nothing to disturb it. Yet, as she looked at him
with the amused smile still edging her lips, she began
for the first time in her life to be afraid.</p>
<p>They kissed each other in silence.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In the limousine, seated beside her husband, she said
presently: &ldquo;I wish Jim would marry Elorn Sharrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s likely to some day, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no hurry,&rdquo; remarked her husband.
&ldquo;He ought not to marry anybody until he&rsquo;s thirty, and
he&rsquo;s only twenty-four. I&rsquo;m glad enough to have him
remain at home with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what worries me; he <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t remain at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband laughed: &ldquo;Well, I meant it merely in
a figurative sense. Of course Jim goes out&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, everywhere, I suppose,&rdquo; said her husband, a
little surprised at her tone.</p>
<p>She said calmly: &ldquo;I hear things&ndash;&ndash;pick up bits of
gossip&ndash;&ndash;as all women do.... And at a tea the
other day a man asked me why Jim never goes to his
clubs any more. So you see he doesn&rsquo;t go to any of
his clubs when he goes &lsquo;out&rsquo; in the evenings....
And he&rsquo;s been to no dances&ndash;&ndash;judging from what is
said to me.... And he doesn&rsquo;t go to see Elorn
Sharrow any more. She told me that herself. So&ndash;&ndash;where
does he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where <i>does</i> he go&ndash;&ndash;every evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t answer&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every evening!&rdquo; she repeated absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Helen&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is on that boy&rsquo;s mind? There&rsquo;s something
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His business, let us hope&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head: &ldquo;I know my son,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. What is particularly troubling you, dear?
There&rsquo;s something you haven&rsquo;t told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m merely wondering who that girl was who lunched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
with him at Delmonico&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;<i>three times</i>&ndash;&ndash;last week,&rdquo;
mused his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s probably all right, Helen. A man
doesn&rsquo;t take the other sort there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; she said drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.... She&rsquo;s very pretty, I understand....
And wears mourning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; he asked, amused. She smiled at him,
but there was a trace of annoyance in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it very natural that I should wonder
who any girl is who lunches with my son three times
in one week?... And is remarkably pretty, besides?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The girl in question looked remarkably pretty at that
very moment, where she sat at her desk, the telephone
transmitter tilted toward her, the receiver at her ear,
and her dark eyes full of gayest malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dumont, please?&rdquo; came a distant and familiar
voice over the wire. The girl laughed aloud; and he
heard her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>said</i> you were not going to call me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it <i>you</i>, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How subtle of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said anxiously. &ldquo;Are you doing anything this
evening&ndash;&ndash;by any unhappy chance&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it! What <i>are</i> you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How impertinent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t mean it that way&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. However, I&rsquo;ll be kind enough to tell
you what I&rsquo;m doing. I&rsquo;m sitting here at my desk,
listening to an irritable young man&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful luck!&rdquo; he exclaimed joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful luck for a girl to sit at a desk and listen
to an irritable young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll stop talking bally nonsense for a moment&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you bully me, I shall stop talking altogether!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you, kind sir; you need not shout!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said humbly: &ldquo;Palla, would you let me drop
in&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop into what? Into poetry? Please do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim! You told me last evening that you expected
to be at the opera to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;So I didn&rsquo;t expect you to call me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I see you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting some people, Jim. It&rsquo;s your own fault;
I didn&rsquo;t expect a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with you this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a party you&rsquo;re giving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three people. But my place is full of
flowers and as pretty as a garden. Too bad you can&rsquo;t
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I come to your garden-party?&rdquo; he asked
humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean just to see my garden for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; let me come around for a moment, anyway&ndash;&ndash;if
you&rsquo;re dressed. Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;m dressed. Did you think it was to be
a garden-of-Eden party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gay, mischievous laughter came distinctly to
him over the wire. Then her mood changed abruptly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You funny boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you understand
that I want you to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You enchanting girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you
really mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! And if you come at once we&rsquo;ll have
nearly an hour together before anybody arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had that sweet, unguarded way with her at
moments, and it always sent a faint shock of surprise
and delight through him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Her smiling maid admitted him and took his hat,
coat and stick as though accustomed to these particular
articles.</p>
<p>Palla was alone in the living-room when he was announced,
and as soon as the maid disappeared she gave
him both hands in swift welcome&ndash;&ndash;an impulsive, unconsidered
greeting entirely new to them both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mind my tormenting you. Did you,
Jim? I was so happy that you did call me up, after
all. Because you know you <i>did</i> tell me yesterday
that you were going to the opera to-night. But all the
same, when the &rsquo;phone rang, somehow I knew it was
you&ndash;&ndash;I knew it&ndash;&ndash;somehow&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She loosened one hand from his and swung him with
the other toward the piano: &ldquo;Do you like my flower
garden? Isn&rsquo;t the room attractive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you are distractingly
pretty to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this dull, black gown? But, <i>merci</i>, anyway!
See how effective your roses are!&ndash;&ndash;the ones you sent
yesterday and the day before! They&rsquo;re all opening.
And I went out and bought a lot more, and all that
fluffy green camouflage&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She withdrew her other hand from his without embarrassment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
and went over to rearrange a sheaf of
deep red carnations, spreading the clustered stems to
wider circumference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this party you&rsquo;re giving, anyway?&rdquo; he
asked, following her across the room and leaning beside
her on the piano, where she still remained very busily
engaged with her decorations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An impromptu party,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I was shopping
this morning&ndash;&ndash;in fact I was buying pots and
pans for the cook&ndash;&ndash;when somebody spoke to me. And
I recognised a university student whom I had known
in Petrograd after the first revolution&ndash;&ndash;Marya Lanois,
her name is&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved aside and began to fuss with a huge bowl
of crimson roses, loosening the blossoms, freeing the
foliage, and talking happily all the while:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marya Lanois,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;an interesting
girl. And with her was a man I had met&ndash;&ndash;a pianist&ndash;&ndash;Vanya
Tchernov. They told me that another friend
of mine&ndash;&ndash;a girl named Ilse Westgard&ndash;&ndash;is now living
in New York. They couldn&rsquo;t dine with me, but they&rsquo;re
coming to supper. So I also called up Ilse Westgard,
she&rsquo;s coming, too;&ndash;&ndash;and I also asked your friend, Mr.
Estridge. So you see, Monsieur, we shall have a little
music and much valuable conversation, and then I shall
give them some supper&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped back from the piano, surveyed her handiwork
critically, then looked around at him for his
opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How jolly your new house is&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;glancing
about the room at the few well chosen pieces
of antique furniture, the harmonious hangings and comfortably
upholstered modern pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really is beginning to be livable; isn&rsquo;t it, Jim?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
she ventured. &ldquo;Of course there are many things yet
to buy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They leisurely made the tour of the white-panelled
room, looking with approval at the delicate Georgian
furniture; the mezzotints; the damask curtains of that
beautiful red which has rose-tints in it, too; the charming
old French clock and its lovely gilded garniture;
the deep-toned ash-grey carpet under foot.</p>
<p>Before the mantel, with its wood fire blazing, they
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so enchantingly homelike,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I
already love it all. When I come in from shopping I
just stand here with my hat and furs on, and gaze
about and adore everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you adore me, too?&rdquo; he asked, laughing at her
warmth. &ldquo;You see I&rsquo;m becoming one of your fixtures
here, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her brown eyes the familiar irresponsible gaiety
began to glimmer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do adore you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve no business to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seated herself on the sofa and cast a veiled
glance at him, enchantingly malicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you know me well enough to adore
me?&rdquo; she inquired with misleading gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I as easy to know as that? Jim, you humiliate
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that you are easy to know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You meant it!&rdquo; she insisted reproachfully. &ldquo;You
think so, too&ndash;&ndash;just because I let myself be picked up&ndash;&ndash;by
a perfectly strange man&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Palla&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began nervously; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
caught the glimmer in her lowered eyes&ndash;&ndash;saw her child&rsquo;s
mouth tremulous with mirth controlled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim!&rdquo; she said, still laughing, &ldquo;do you think
I care how we met? How absurd of you to let me
torment you. You&rsquo;re altogether too boyish, too self-conscious.
You&rsquo;re loaded down with all the silly traditions
which I&rsquo;ve thrown away. I don&rsquo;t care how we
met. I&rsquo;m glad we know each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened a silver box on a little table at her
elbow, chose a cigarette, lighted it, and offered it to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather like the taste of them now,&rdquo; she remarked,
making room for him on the sofa beside her.</p>
<p>When he was seated, she reached up to a jar of
flowers on the piano, selected a white carnation, broke
it short, and then drew the stem through his lapel,
patting the blossom daintily into a pom-pon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;ll straighten
your tie. Shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned toward her; she accomplished that deftly,
then glanced across at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only half an hour longer to ourselves,&rdquo; she
exclaimed, with that unconscious candour which always
thrilled him. Then, turning to him, she said laughingly:
&ldquo;Does it really matter how two people meet
when time races with us like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you realise,&rdquo; he said in a low, tense voice,
&ldquo;that since I met you every racing minute has been
sweeping me headlong toward you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was so totally unprepared for the deeper emotion
in his voice and bearing&ndash;&ndash;so utterly surprised&ndash;&ndash;that
she merely gazed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been aware of it, Palla?&rdquo; he said, looking
her in the eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;you are disconcerting! You
never before have taken such a tone toward me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose, walked over to the clock, examined it
minutely for a few moments. Then she turned, cast a
swift, perplexed glance at him, and came slowly back
to resume her place on the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men should be very, very careful what they say
to me.&rdquo; As she lifted her eyes he saw them beginning
to glimmer again with that irresponsible humour he
knew so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; she said, her brown gaze gay with
warning; &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m godless and quite lawless, and I&rsquo;m
a very dangerous companion for any well-behaved and
orthodox young man who ventures to tell me that
I&rsquo;m adorable. Why, you might as safely venture to
adore Diana of the Ephesians! And you know what she
did to her admirers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was really Aphrodite, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he said,
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aphrodite, Venus, Isis, Lada&ndash;&ndash;and the Ephesian
Diana&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m afraid they all were hussies. But I&rsquo;m
a hussy, too, Jim! If you doubt it, ask any well
brought up girl you know and tell her how we met and
how we&rsquo;ve behaved ever since, and what obnoxious
ideas I entertain toward all things conventional and
orthodox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla, are you really serious?&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m never entirely
sure what is under your badinage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I am serious. I don&rsquo;t believe in
any of the things that you believe in. I&rsquo;ve often told
you so, though you don&rsquo;t believe me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, I tell you. I did once. But I&rsquo;m awake.
No &lsquo;threats of hell or hopes of any sugary paradise&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
influence me. Nor does custom and convention. Nor
do the laws and teachings of our present civilisation
matter one straw to me. I&rsquo;d break every law if it
suited me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed and lifted her hand from her lap: &ldquo;You
funny child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t steal, for example&ndash;&ndash;would
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t desire to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you commit perjury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a law of my own, kind sir. It doesn&rsquo;t
happen to permit murder, arson, forgery, piracy,
smuggling&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their irresponsible laughter interrupted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else wouldn&rsquo;t you do?&rdquo; he managed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything mean, deceitful, dishonest,
cruel. But it&rsquo;s not your antiquated laws&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s my own
and original law that governs my conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always conform to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. But you don&rsquo;t conform to yours. So I&rsquo;ll
try to help you remember the petty but always sacred
conventions of our own accepted code&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, with unfeigned malice, she began to disengage
her hand from his&ndash;&ndash;loosened the slim fingers one by
one, all the while watching him sideways with prim
lips pursed and lifted eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try always to remember,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that, according
to your code, any demonstration of affection toward
a comparative stranger is exceedingly bad form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he picked up her hand again, which she
had carelessly left lying on the sofa near his, and again
she freed it, leisurely.</p>
<p>They conversed animatedly, as always, discussing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
matters of common interest, yet faintly in her ears
sounded the unfamiliar echo of passion.</p>
<p>It haunted her mind, too&ndash;&ndash;an indefinable undertone
delicately persistent&ndash;&ndash;until at last she sat mute, absent-minded,
while he continued speaking.</p>
<p>Her stillness&ndash;&ndash;her remote gaze, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;presently
silenced him. And after a little while she turned her
charming head and looked at him with that unintentional
provocation born of virginal curiosity.</p>
<p>What had moved him so unexpectedly to deeper
emotion? Had she? Had she, then, that power? And
without effort?&ndash;&ndash;For she had been conscious of none....
But&ndash;&ndash;if she tried.... Had she the
power to move him again?</p>
<p>Na&iuml;ve instinct&ndash;&ndash;the emotionless curiosity of total inexperience&ndash;&ndash;everything
embryonic and innocently ruthless
in her was now in the ascendant.</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes and considered him with the
speculative candour of a child. She wished to hear once
more that unfamiliar <i>something</i> in his voice&ndash;&ndash;see it in
his features&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And she did not know how to evoke it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what are you thinking, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of you,&rdquo; she answered candidly, without other intention
than the truth. And saw, instantly, the indefinable
<i>something</i> born again into his eyes.</p>
<p>Calm curiosity, faintly amused, possessed her&ndash;&ndash;left
him possessed of her hand presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you attempting to be sentimental?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Very leisurely she began once more to disengage her
hand&ndash;&ndash;loosening the fingers one by one&ndash;&ndash;and watching
him all the while with a slight smile edging her lips.
Then, as his clasp tightened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;may I not have my freedom?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never did this before&ndash;&ndash;touched me&ndash;&ndash;unnecessarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he made no answer, she fell silent, her dark eyes
vaguely interrogative as though questioning herself as
well as him concerning this unaccustomed contact.</p>
<p>His head had been bent a little. Now he lifted it.
Neither was smiling.</p>
<p>Suddenly she rose to her feet and stood with her
head partly averted. He rose, too. Neither spoke.
But after a moment she turned and looked straight at
him, the virginal curiosity clear in her eyes. And he
took her into his arms.</p>
<p>Her arms had fallen to her side. She endured his lips
gravely, then turned her head and looked at the roses
beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that we would do this.
Now let me go, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He released her in silence. She walked slowly to the
mantel and set one slim foot on the fender.</p>
<p>Without looking around at him she said: &ldquo;Does this
spoil me for you, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You darling&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me frankly. Does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth do you mean, Palla! Does it spoil
<i>me</i> for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking.... No, it doesn&rsquo;t. But
I wondered about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came over to where she stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; he said unsteadily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;m
very desperately in love with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she turned her enchanting little head toward
him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If you are,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there need be nothing desperate
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you care enough to marry me, you
darling?&rdquo; he asked impetuously. &ldquo;Will you, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; she said candidly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that.
I meant that I care for you quite as much as you care
for me. So you need not be desperate. But I really
don&rsquo;t think we are in love&ndash;&ndash;I mean sufficiently&ndash;&ndash;for
anything serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you think so!&rdquo; he demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish me to be quite frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; She lifted her head and let her clear
eyes rest on his. &ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I even like&ndash;&ndash;what
we did. I like you far better than any man
I ever knew. But I do not care for you enough to give
up my freedom of mind and of conduct for your asking.
I do not care enough for you to subscribe to your
religion and your laws. And that&rsquo;s the tragic truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what on earth has all that to do with it? I
haven&rsquo;t asked you to believe as I believe or to subscribe
to any law&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her enchanting laughter filled the room: &ldquo;Yes, you
have! You asked me to marry you, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t, Jim, because I don&rsquo;t believe in the
law of marriage, civil or religious. If I loved you
I&rsquo;d live with you unmarried. But I&rsquo;m afraid to try it.
And so are you. Which proves that I&rsquo;m not really in
love with you, or you with me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door bell rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do care for you,&rdquo; she whispered, bending
swiftly toward him. Her lips rested lightly on his a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
moment, then she turned and walked out into the centre
of the room.</p>
<p>The maid announced: &ldquo;Mr. Estridge!&rdquo;</p>
<div class='chsp'>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Young Shotwell, still too incredulous to be either
hurt or angry, stood watching Palla welcoming
her guests, who arrived within a few minutes of
each other.</p>
<p>First came Estridge,&ndash;&ndash;handsome, athletic, standing
over six feet, and already possessed of that winning and
reassuring manner which means success for a physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice of you to ask me, Palla,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And
is Miss Westgard really coming to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here she is now!&rdquo; exclaimed Palla, as the maid
announced her. &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;Ilse! You astonishing girl! How
long have you been in New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Shotwell beheld the six-foot goddess for the
first time&ndash;&ndash;gazed with pleasurable awe upon this young
super-creature with the sea-blue eyes and golden hair
and a skin of roses and cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy, Palla!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I came immediately back
from Stockholm, but you had sailed on the <i>Elsinore</i>,
and I was obliged to wait!&ndash;&ndash;Oh!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; catching sight of
Estridge as he advanced&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I am so very happy to see
you again!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;giving him her big, exquisitely sculptured
hand. &ldquo;Except for Mr. Brisson, we are quite
complete in our little company of death!&rdquo; She laughed
her healthy, undisturbed defiance of that human enemy
as she named him, gazed rapturously at Palla, acknowledged
Shotwell&rsquo;s presentation in her hearty, engaging
way, then turned laughingly to Estridge:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The world whirls like a wheel in a squirrel cage
which we all tread:&ndash;&ndash;only to find ourselves together
after travelling many, many miles at top speed!...
Are you well, John Estridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;but nobody except the immortals
could ever be as well as you, Ilse Westgard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed in sheer exuberance of her own physical
vigour: &ldquo;Only that old and toothless nemesis of
Loki can slay me, John Estridge!&rdquo; And, to Palla:
&ldquo;I had some slight trouble in Stockholm. Fancy!&ndash;&ndash;a
little shrimp of a man approached me on the street one
evening when there chanced to be nobody near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the first I knew he was mouthing and grinning
and saying to me in Russian: &lsquo;I know you, hired
mercenary of the aristocrats!&ndash;&ndash;I know you!&ndash;&ndash;big white
battle horse that carried the bloody war-god!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was too astonished, my dear; I merely gazed
upon this small and agitated toad, who continued to
run alongside and grimace and pull funny faces at
me. He appeared to be furious, and he said some
very vile things to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was disgusted and walked faster, and he had to
run. And all the while he was squealing at me: &lsquo;I know
you! You keep out of America, do you hear? If
you sail on that steamer, we follow you and kill you!
You hear it what I say? We kill! Kill! Kill!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw up her superb head and laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see him&ndash;&ndash;this insect&ndash;&ndash;Palla!&ndash;&ndash;so small
and hairy, with crazy eyes like little sparks among the
furry whiskers!&ndash;&ndash;and running, running at heel, underfoot,
one side and then the other, and squealing &lsquo;Kill!
Kill? Kill&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had made them see the picture and they all
laughed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But all the same,&rdquo; she added, turning to Estridge,
&ldquo;from that evening I became conscious that people were
watching me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the same in Copenhagen and in Christiania&ndash;&ndash;always
I felt that somebody was watching me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have any trouble?&rdquo; asked Estridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;there seemed to be so many unaccountable
delays, obstacles in securing proper papers, trouble
about luggage and steamer accommodations&ndash;&ndash;petty
annoyances,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;And also I am sure that
letters to me were opened, and others which I should
have received never arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe it was due to the Reds?&rdquo; asked Palla.
&ldquo;Have they emissaries in Scandinavia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, their agents and spies swarm everywhere
over the world!&rdquo; said Ilse calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; remarked Shotwell, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; rejoined Ilse quickly, &ldquo;I ask your pardon,
but America, also, is badly infested by these people.
As their Black Plague spreads out over the entire
world, so spread out the Bolsheviki to infect all with
the red sickness that slays whole nations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a few local Reds,&rdquo; he said, unconvinced,
&ldquo;but I had scarcely supposed&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell rang: Miss Lanois and Mr. Tchernov were
announced, greeted warmly by Palla, and presented.</p>
<p>Both spoke the beautiful English of educated Russians;
Vanya Tchernov, a wonderfully handsome youth,
saluted Palla&rsquo;s hand in Continental fashion, and met the
men with engaging formality.</p>
<p>Shotwell found himself seated beside Marya Lanois,
a lithe, warm, golden creature with greenish golden
eyes that slanted, and the strawberry complexion that
goes with reddish hair.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You are happy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with all your streets
full of bright flags and your victorious soldiers arriving
home by every troopship. Ah!&ndash;&ndash;but Russia is the
most unhappy of all countries to-day, Mr. Shotwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terribly sad,&rdquo; he said sympathetically. &ldquo;We
Americans don&rsquo;t seem to know whether to send an
army to help you, or merely to stand aside and let
Russia find herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should send troops!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is it not
so, Ilse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sane people should unite,&rdquo; replied the girl, her
beautiful face becoming serious. &ldquo;It will arrive at
that the world over&ndash;&ndash;the sane against the insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is only the bourgeoisie that is sane,&rdquo; said
Vanya Tchernov, in his beautifully modulated voice.
&ldquo;The extremes are both abnormal&ndash;&ndash;aristocrats and
Bolsheviki alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We social revolutionists,&rdquo; said Marya Lanois,
&ldquo;were called extremists yesterday and are called reactionists
to-day. But we are the world&rsquo;s balance.
This war was fought for our ideals; your American
soldiers marched for them: the hun failed because of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there remains only one more war,&rdquo; said Ilse
Westgard,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the war against those outlaws we call
Capital and Labour&ndash;&ndash;two names for two robbers that
have disturbed the world&rsquo;s peace long enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two tyrants,&rdquo; said Marya, &ldquo;who trample us to
war upon each other&ndash;&ndash;who outrage us, crush us, cripple
us with their ferocious feuds. What are the Bolsheviki?
&lsquo;Those who want more.&rsquo; Then the name belongs
as well to the capitalists. They, also, are Bolsheviki&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;men
who always want more!&rsquo; And these are the
two quarrelling Bolsheviki giants who trample
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
us&ndash;&ndash;Lord Labour, Lord Capital&ndash;&ndash;the devil of envy against
the devil of greed!&ndash;&ndash;war to the death! And, to the
survivor, the bones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell, a little astonished to hear from the red
lips of this warm young creature the bitter cynicisms
of the proletariat, asked her to define more clearly where
the Bolsheviki stood, and for what they stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said, lying back on the sofa and adjusting
her lithe body to a more luxurious position among
the pillows, &ldquo;it amounts to this, Mr. Shotwell, that a
new doctrine is promulgated in the world&ndash;&ndash;the cult
of the under-dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in all dog-fights, if the under-dog ever gets
on top, then he, also, will try to kill the ci-devant who
has now become the under-dog.&rdquo; And she laughed at
him out of her green eyes that slanted so enchantingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that there always will be an under-dog
in the battle between capital and labour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. Their snarling, biting, and endless battle
is a nuisance.&rdquo; She smiled again: &ldquo;We should knock
them both on the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; explained Ilse, &ldquo;that when we speak
of the two outlaws as Capital and Labour, we don&rsquo;t
mean legitimate capital and genuine labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never fight,&rdquo; added Tchernov, smiling, &ldquo;because
they are one and the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; remarked Marya, &ldquo;even the united
suffer occasionally from internal pains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The remedy,&rdquo; added Vanya, &ldquo;is to consult a physician.
That is&ndash;&ndash;arbitration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse said: &ldquo;Force is good! But one uses it legitimately
only against rabid things.&rdquo; She turned affectionately
to Palla and took her hands: &ldquo;Your wonderful
Law of Love solves all phenomena except insanity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
With rabies it can not deal. Only force remains to
solve that problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Palla, &ldquo;so much insanity can be
controlled by kind treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge agreed, but remarked that strait-jackets
and padded cells would always be necessary in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the Bolsheviki,&rdquo; said Marya, turning her
warm young face to Shotwell with a lissome movement
of the shoulders, almost caressing, &ldquo;in the beginning
we social revolutionists agreed with them and believed
in them. Why not? Kerensky was an incapable
dreamer&ndash;&ndash;so sensitive that if you spoke rudely to
him he shrank away wounded to the soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not a leader! And the Cadets were plotting,
and the Cossacks loomed like a tempest on the horizon.
And then came Korniloff! And the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The peace of Brest,&rdquo; explained Vanya, in his gentle
voice, &ldquo;awoke us to what the Red Soviets stood for.
We saw Christ crucified again. And understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marya sat up straight on the sofa, running her
dazzling white fingers over her hair&ndash;&ndash;hair that seemed
tiger-red, and very vaguely scented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For thirty pieces of silver,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Judas sold
the world. What Lenine and Trotsky sold was paid
for in yellow metal, and there were more pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse said: &ldquo;Babushka is dying of it. That is enough
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vanya replied: &ldquo;Where the source is infected, drinkers
die at the river&rsquo;s mouth. Little Marie Spiridonova
perished. Countess Panina succumbed. Alexandria
Kolontar will die from its poison. And, as these died,
so shall Ivan and Vera die also, unless that polluted
source be cleansed.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>Marya rested her tawny young head on the cushions
again and smiled at Shotwell:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s confusing even to Russians,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;like
a crazy Bakst spectacle at the Marinsky. I wonder
what you must think of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But on her expressive mouth the word &ldquo;us&rdquo; might
almost have meant &ldquo;me,&rdquo; and he paid her the easy compliment
which came naturally to him, while she looked
at him out of lazy and very lovely eyes as green as
beryls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tiche</i>,&rdquo; she murmured, smiling, &ldquo;<i>ce n&rsquo;est pas moi
l&rsquo;&eacute;tat, monsieur</i>.&rdquo; And laughed while her indolent
glance slanted sideways on Vanya, and lingered there
as though in leisurely but amiable appraisal.</p>
<p>The girl was evidently very young, but there seemed
to be an indefinable something about her that hinted
of experience beyond her years.</p>
<p>Palla had been looking at her&ndash;&ndash;from Shotwell to
her&ndash;&ndash;and Marya&rsquo;s sixth sense was already aware of it
and asking why.</p>
<p>For between two females of the human species the
constant occult interplay is like steady lighting. With
invisible antenn&aelig; they touch one another incessantly,
delicately exploring inside that grosser aura which is
all that the male perceives.</p>
<p>And finally Marya looked back at Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May Mr. Tchernov play for us?&rdquo; asked Palla, smiling,
as though some vague authority in the matter
were vested in this young girl with the tiger-hair.</p>
<p>Her eyes closed indolently, and opened again as
though digesting the subtlety: then, disdainfully accepting
the assumption: &ldquo;Oh, Vanya,&rdquo; she called out
carelessly, &ldquo;play a little for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The handsome youth bowed in his absent, courteous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
way. There was about him a simplicity entirely winning
as he seated himself at the piano.</p>
<p>But his playing revealed a maturity and nobility
of mind scarcely expected of such gentleness and youth.</p>
<p>Never had Palla heard Beethoven until that moment.</p>
<p>He did not drift. There was no caprice to offend
when he turned with courtly logic from one great
master to another.</p>
<p>Only when Estridge asked for something &ldquo;typically
Russian&rdquo; did the charming dignity of the sequence
break. Vanya laughed and looked at Marya Lanois:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means you must sing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She sang, resting where she was among the silken
cushions;&ndash;&ndash;the song, one of those epics of ancient
Moscow, lauded Ivan IV. and the taking of Kazan.</p>
<p>The music was bizarre; the girl&rsquo;s voice bewitching;
and though the song was of the <i>Beliny</i>, it had been
made into brief couplets, and it ended very quickly.</p>
<p>Laughing at the applause, she sang a song of the
<i>Skomorokhi</i>; then a cradle song, infinitely tender and
strange, built upon the Chinese scale; and another&ndash;&ndash;a
Cossack song&ndash;&ndash;built, also, upon the pentatonic scale.</p>
<p>Discussions intruded then; the diversion ended the
music.</p>
<p>Palla presently rose, spoke to Vanya and Estridge,
and came over to where Jim Shotwell sat beside Marya.</p>
<p>Interrupted, they both looked up, and Jim rose as
Estridge also presented himself to Marya.</p>
<p>Palla said: &ldquo;If you will take me out, Jim, we can
show everybody the way.&rdquo; And to Marya: &ldquo;Just a
little supper, you know&ndash;&ndash;but the dining room is below.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Her pretty drawing-room was only partly furnished&ndash;&ndash;an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
expensive but genuine set of old Aubusson being
her limit for the time.</p>
<p>But beyond, in the rear, the little glass doors opened
on a charming dining-room, the old Georgian mahogany
of which was faded to a golden hue. Curtains,
too, were golden shot with palest mauve; and two
Imperial Chinese panels of ancient silk, miraculously
embroidered and set with rainbow Ho-ho birds, were
the only hangings on the walls. And they seemed to
illuminate the room like sunshine.</p>
<p>Shotwell, who knew nothing about such things but
envisaged them with reverence, seated Palla and presently
took his place beside her.</p>
<p>His neighbour on his left was Marya, again&ndash;&ndash;an arrangement
which Palla might have altered had it
occurred to her upstairs.</p>
<p>Estridge, very animated, and apparently happy, recalled
to Palla their last dinner together, and their
dance.</p>
<p>Palla laughed: &ldquo;You said I drank too much champagne,
John Estridge! Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I do. You had a cunning little bunn,
Palla&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not! I merely asked you and Mr. Brisson
what it felt like to be intoxicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did your best to be a sport,&rdquo; he insisted,
&ldquo;but you almost passed away over your first cigarette!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; cried Ilse, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let them tease you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla, rather pink, laughingly denied any aspirations
toward sportdom; and she presently ventured a
glance at Shotwell, to see how he took all this.</p>
<p>But already Marya had engaged him in half smiling,
low-voiced conversation; and Palla looked at her golden-green
eyes and warm, rich colouring, cooled by a skin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
of snow. Tiger-golden, the <i>rousse</i> ensemble; the
supple movement of limb and body fascinated her;
but most of all the lovely, slanting eyes with their
glint of beryl amid melting gold.</p>
<p>Estridge spoke to Marya; as the girl turned slightly,
Palla said to Shotwell:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you find them interesting&ndash;&ndash;my guests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned instantly to her, but it seemed to her as
though there were a slight haze in his eyes&ndash;&ndash;a fixedness&ndash;&ndash;which
cleared, however, as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are delightful&ndash;&ndash;all of them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your
blond goddess yonder is rather overpowering, but
beautiful to gaze upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Vanya?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming; astonishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovable,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;Marya?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather bewildering,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Fascinating, I
should say. Is she very learned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been in the universities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... I don&rsquo;t know how learned she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very young,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>It was on the tip of Palla&rsquo;s tongue to say something;
and she remained silent&ndash;&ndash;lest this man misinterpret her
motive&ndash;&ndash;and, perhaps, lest her own conscience misinterpret
it, too.</p>
<p>Ilse said it to Estridge, however, frankly insouciant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Marya and Vanya are married&ndash;&ndash;that is,
they live together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Shotwell heard her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; he said in a low voice to Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>He remained silent so long that she added: &ldquo;The tie
is not looser than the old-fashioned one. More rigid,
perhaps, because they are on their honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they tire of each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, also, have divorce,&rdquo; said the girl, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beastly to live together where love does not
exist. People who believe as they do&ndash;&ndash;as I do&ndash;&ndash;merely
separate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And contract another alliance if they wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not your divorcees remarry if they wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What becomes of the children?&rdquo; he demanded
sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What becomes of them when your courts divorce
their parents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. It&rsquo;s all a parody on lawful regularity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you speak of it that way&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face flushed and she extended her hand
toward her wine glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend to hurt you, Palla,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She drew a quick breath, looked up, smiled: &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; she said. Then into her brown eyes
came the delicious glimmer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I whisper to you, Jim? Is it too rude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He inclined his head and felt the thrill of her breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we drink one glass together&ndash;&ndash;to each other
alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a dear comradeship, and close!... And
not too desperate!&rdquo; she added, as her glance flashed
into hidden laughter.</p>
<p>They drank, not daring to look toward each other.
And Palla&rsquo;s careless gaze, slowly sweeping the circle,
finally met Marya&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;as she knew it must. Both smiled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
touching each other at once with invisible antenn&aelig;&ndash;&ndash;always
searching, exploring under the glimmering aura
what no male ever discovered or comprehended.</p>
<p>There was, in the living room above, a little more
music&ndash;&ndash;a song or two before the guests departed.</p>
<p>Marya, a little apart, turned to Shotwell:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You find our Russian folk-song amusing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, by any chance, you should remember that I am
at home on Thursdays, there is a song I think that
might interest you.&rdquo; She let her eyes rest on him
with a curious stillness in their depths:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The song is called <i>Lada</i>,&rdquo; she said in a voice so
low that he just heard her. The next moment she was
taking leave of Palla; kissed her. Vanya enveloped
her in her wrap.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Estridge called up a taxi; and presently went away
with Ilse.</p>
<p>Very slowly Palla came back to the centre of the
room, where Shotwell stood. The scent of flowers was
in his nostrils, his throat; the girl herself seemed saturated
with their perfume as he took her into his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t like my friends, Jim,&rdquo; she ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid they might have shocked you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said drily: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a case of being shocked. It&rsquo;s
more like being bored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. My friends bore you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their morals do.... Is Ilse that sort, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she is.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not inclined to bother herself with the formalities
of marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mischievous, ridiculous, immoral business!&rdquo; he
said hotly. &ldquo;Why, to look at you&ndash;&ndash;at Ilse&ndash;&ndash;at Miss
Lanois&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t look like very immoral people, do we?&rdquo;
she said, laughingly.</p>
<p>The light raillery in her laughter angered him, and
he released her and began to pace the room nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Palla,&rdquo; he said roughly, &ldquo;suppose I accept
you at your own valuation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I value myself very highly, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. That&rsquo;s why I ask you to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I tell you I don&rsquo;t believe in marriage,&rdquo; she
rejoined coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A magistrate can marry us&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference. A ceremony, civil or religious,
is entirely out of the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said, incensed, &ldquo;that you refuse to
be married by any law at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own law is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;well, then,&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;what&ndash;&ndash;what
sort of procedure&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;<i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were in love with you I&rsquo;d not be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her calm candour infuriated him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine that you and I could ever get away
with a situation like that!&rdquo; he blazed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you become so irritable and excited, Jim?
We&rsquo;re not going to try&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation! I should think not!&rdquo; he retorted, so
violently that her mouth quivered. But she kept her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
head averted until the swift emotion was under control.</p>
<p>Then she said in a low voice: &ldquo;If you really think
me immoral, Jim, I can understand your manner toward
me. Otherwise&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla, dear! Forgive me! I&rsquo;m just worried
sick&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You funny boy,&rdquo; she said with her quick, frank
smile, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to worry you. Listen! It&rsquo;s all
quite simple. I care for you very much indeed. I
don&rsquo;t mind your&ndash;&ndash;caressing&ndash;&ndash;me&ndash;&ndash;sometimes. But I&rsquo;m
not in love. I just care a lot for you.... But
not nearly enough to love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla, you&rsquo;re hopeless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Because I am so respectful toward love?
Of course I am. A girl who believes as I do can&rsquo;t
afford to make a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he said eagerly, &ldquo;but under the law, if
a mistake is made every woman has her remedy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her <i>remedy</i>! What do you mean? You can&rsquo;t
pass one of those roses through the flame of that fire
and still have your rose, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what happens under <i>your</i> laws, as well
as outside of them. No! I don&rsquo;t love you. Under
your law I&rsquo;d be afraid to marry you. Under mine
I&rsquo;m deathly afraid.... Because&ndash;&ndash;I know&ndash;&ndash;that
where love is there can be no fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your answer, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>He had called her up the following morning from
the office, and had told her that he thought he
had better not see her for a while.</p>
<p>And she had answered with soft concern that he must
do what he thought best without considering her.</p>
<p>What other answer he expected is uncertain; but her
gentle acquiescence in his decision irritated him and he
ended the conversation in a tone of boyish resentment.</p>
<p>To occupy his mind there was, that day, not only
the usual office routine, but some extra business most
annoying to Sharrow. For Angelo Puma had turned
up again, as shiny and bland as ever, flashing his
superb smile over clerk and stenographer impartially.</p>
<p>So Sharrow shunted him to Mr. Brooke, that sort
of property being his specialty; and Brooke called in
Shotwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go up town with that preposterous wop and settle
this business one way or another, once for all,&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;A crook named Skidder owns the property;
but we can&rsquo;t do anything with him. The office
is heartily sick of both Skidder and Puma; and Sharrow
desires to be rid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, very cordially, he introduced Puma to young
Shotwell; and they took Puma&rsquo;s handsome car and went
up town to see what could be done with the slippery
owner of the property in question, who was now permanently
located in New York.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>On the way, Puma, smelling oppressively aromatic
and looking conspicuously glossy as to hair, hat, and
boots, also became effusively voluble. For he had
instantly recognised Shotwell as the young man with
whom that disturbingly pretty girl had been in consultation
in Sharrow&rsquo;s offices; and his mind was now
occupied with a new possibility as well as with the
property which he so persistently desired to acquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me,&rdquo; he said in his animated, exotic way, and
all creased with smiles, &ldquo;my cinema business is not business
alone! No! It is Art! It is the art hunger that
ever urges me onward, not the desire for commercial
gain. For me, beauty is ever first; the box-office last!
You understand, Mr. Shotwell? With me, art is
supreme! Yes. And afterward my crust of bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why you don&rsquo;t
pay this man Skidder what he asks for the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you why. I make it clear to you. For argument&ndash;&ndash;Skidder
he has ever the air of one who does
not care to sell. It is an attitude! I know! But he
has that air. Well! I say to him, &lsquo;Mr. Skidder, I
offer you&ndash;&ndash;we say for argument, one dollar! Yes?&rsquo;
Well, he do not say yes or no. He do not say, &lsquo;I take
a dollar and also one quarter. Or a dollar and a
half. Or two dollars.&rsquo; No. He squint and answer:
&lsquo;I am not anxious to sell!&rsquo; My God! What can one
say? What can one do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Jim, &ldquo;he really doesn&rsquo;t want
to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! That is not so. No. He is sly, Mr. Skidder,
like there never has been in my experience a man more
sly. What is it he desires? I ask. I do not know.
But all the time he inquire about my business if it pays,
and is there much money in it. Also, I hear, by channels,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
that he makes everywhere inquiries if the film
business shall pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he wants to try it himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, that has occurred to me. But to him I say
nothing. No. He is too sly. Me, I am all art and
all heart. Me, I am frank like there never was a man
in my business! But Skidder, he squint at me. My
God, those eye! And I do not know what is in his
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Puma, what do you wish me to do? As
I understand it, you are our client, and if I buy for
you this Skidder property I shall look to you, of course,
for my commission. Is that what you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! Why should he not pay that commission
if you are sufficiently obliging to buy from him his
property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t done that way,&rdquo; explained Jim drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suppose you can buy me this property? Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Of course, I can buy anything for
you if you&rsquo;ll pay enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! I do not enjoy commercial business. No.
I enjoy art. I enjoy qualities of the heart. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
He looked at Jim out of his magnificent black eyes,
touched his full lips with a perfumed handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said, flashing a brilliant smile, &ldquo;I am
all heart. But my heart is for art alone! I dedicate
it to the film, to the moving picture, to beauty! It
is my constant preoccupation. It is my only thought.
Art, beauty, the picture, the world made happier,
better, for the beauty which I offer in my pictures.
It is my only thought. It is my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim politely suppressed a yawn and said that a
life devoted purely to art was a laudable sacrifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As example!&rdquo; explained Puma, all animation and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
childlike frankness; &ldquo;I pay my artists what they ask.
What is money when it is a question of art? I must
have quality; I must have beauty&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He shrugged:
&ldquo;I must pay. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One usually pays for pulchritude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! As example! I watch always on the streets
as I pass by. I see a face. It has beauty. It has
quality. I follow. I speak. I am frank like there
never was a man. I say, &lsquo;Mademoiselle, you shall not
be offended. No. Art has no frontiers. It is my
art, not I who address you. I am Angelo Puma. The
Ultra-Film Company is mine. In you I perceive possibilities.
This is my card. If it interests you to have
a test, come! Who knows? It may be your life&rsquo;s
destiny. The projection room should tell. Adieu!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the way you pick stars?&rdquo; asked Jim
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stars? Bah! I care nothing for stars. No. I
should go bankrupt. Why? Beauty alone is my star.
Upon it I drape the mantle of Art!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed his fat finger-tips and gazed triumphantly
at Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see? Out of the crowd of passersby I pick
the perfect and unconscious rosebud. In my temple
it opens into perfect bloom. And Art is born! And
I am content. You comprehend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim said that he thought he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As example,&rdquo; exclaimed Puma vivaciously, &ldquo;while
in conversation once with Mr. Sharrow, I beheld entering
your office a young lady in mourning. Hah!
Instantly I was all art!&rdquo; Again he kissed his gloved
fingers. &ldquo;A face for a picture! A form for the
screen! I perceive. I am convinced.... You
recall the event, perhaps, Mr. Shotwell?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young lady in mourning, seated beside your desk?
I believe she was buying from you a house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name&ndash;&ndash;Miss Dumont&ndash;&ndash;I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim glanced at him. &ldquo;Miss Dumont is not likely to do
anything of that sort,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean go into the movies?&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;She
wouldn&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;my God! It is Art! What you call movies,
and, within, this young lady may hide genius. And
genius belongs to Art. And Art belongs to the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unthinkable idea of Palla on the screen was
peculiarly distasteful to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dumont has no inclination for the movies,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Mr. Shotwell,&rdquo; purred Puma, &ldquo;if your
amiable influence could induce the young lady to have
a test made&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a chance of it,&rdquo; said Jim bluntly. Their
limousine stopped just then. They got out before one
of those new apartment houses on the upper West Side.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Mr. Skidder, it appeared, was in and would receive
them.</p>
<p>A negro servant opened the door and ushered them
into a parlour where Mr. Elmer Skidder, sprawling
over the d&eacute;bris of breakfast, laid aside newspaper and
coffee cup and got up to receive them in bath robe and
slippers.</p>
<p>And when they were all seated: &ldquo;Now, Mr. Skidder,&rdquo;
said Jim, with his engaging frankness, &ldquo;the simplest
way is the quickest. My client, Mr. Puma, wants to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
purchase your property; and he is, I understand,
prepared to pay considerably more than it is worth.
We all have a very fair idea of its actual value.
Our appraiser, yours, and other appraisers from
other companies and corporations seem, for a wonder,
to agree in their appraisal of this particular property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how much more than it is worth do you expect
us to offer you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skidder had never before been dealt with in just this
way. He squinted at Jim, trying to appraise him.
But within his business experience in a country town
no similar young man had he encountered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t asking you to buy, am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand that,&rdquo; rejoined Jim, good humouredly;
&ldquo;<i>we</i> are asking <i>you</i> to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to want it pretty bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; said the young fellow, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Make your offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim named the sum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; snapped Skidder, picking up his newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; remarked Jim, looking: frankly at Puma,
&ldquo;that definitely lets us out.&rdquo; And, to Skidder: &ldquo;Many
thanks for permitting us to interrupt your breakfast.
No need to bother you again, Mr. Skidder.&rdquo; And he
offered his hand in smiling finality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Skidder, &ldquo;the property is worth
all I ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s worth that to you,&rdquo; said Jim pleasantly,
&ldquo;you should keep it.&rdquo; And he turned away toward
the door, wondering why Puma did not follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you two gentlemen in a rush?&rdquo; demanded
Skidder.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I have other business, of course,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down. Hell! Will you have a drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were again seated, Skidder squinted
sideways at Angelo Puma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a partner?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please?&rdquo; replied Puma, as though mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want more capital to put into your fillum concern?&rdquo;
demanded Skidder.</p>
<p>Puma, innocently perplexed, asked mutely for an explanation
out of his magnificent dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got money,&rdquo; asserted Skidder.</p>
<p>Puma&rsquo;s dazzling smile congratulated him upon the
accumulation of a fabulous fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had you looked up,&rdquo; continued Skidder. &ldquo;It
listened good. And&ndash;&ndash;I got money, too. And I got
that property in my vest pocket. See. And there&rsquo;s
a certain busted fillum corporation can be bought for
a postage stamp&ndash;&ndash;all &rsquo;ncorporated &rsquo;n everything. You
get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No; Mr. Puma, who was all art and heart, could
not comprehend what Mr. Skidder was driving at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This here busted fillum company is called the <i>Super-Picture
Fillums</i>,&rdquo; said Skidder. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with you and me buying it? Don&rsquo;t you ever do a little
tradin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim rose, utterly disgusted, but immensely amused
at himself, and realising, now, how entirely right
Sharrow had been in desiring to be rid of this man
Skidder, and of Puma and the property in question.</p>
<p>He said, still smiling, but rather grimly: &ldquo;I see, now,
that this is no place for a broker who lives by his commissions.&rdquo;
And he bade them adieu with perfect good
humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a seegar?&rdquo; inquired Skidder blandly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you go, sir?&rdquo; asked Puma innocently. No
doubt, being all heart and art, he did not comprehend
that brokers can not exist on cigars alone.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>His commission had gone glimmering. Sharrow, evidently
foreseeing something of that sort, had sent him
out with Puma to meet Skidder and rid the office of
the dubious affair.</p>
<p>This Jim understood, and yet he was not particularly
pleased to be exploited by this bland pair who had come
suddenly to an understanding under his very nose&ndash;&ndash;the
understanding of two petty, dickering, crossroad traders,
which coolly excluded any possibility both of his
services and of his commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only a kike lawyer is required now,&rdquo; he said
to himself, as he crossed the street and entered Central
Park. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been properly trimmed by a perfumed
wop and a squinting yap,&rdquo; he thought with intense
amusement. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re well clear of them for good.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The park was wintry and unattractive. Few pedestrians
were abroad, but motors sparkled along distant
drives in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Presently his way ran parallel to one of these drives.
And he had been walking only a little while when a
limousine veered in, slowing down abreast of him, and
he saw a white-gloved hand tapping the pane.</p>
<p>He felt himself turning red as he went up, hat in
hand, to open the door and speak to the girl inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you doing?&rdquo; she demanded,
laughingly, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;walking all by your wild lone in the
park on a wintry day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He explained. She made room for him and he got in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rather hoped you&rsquo;d be at the opera last night,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
she said, but without any reproach in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to go, Elorn&ndash;&ndash;but something came up to
prevent it,&rdquo; he added, flushing again. &ldquo;Were they
singing anything new?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you missed nothing,&rdquo; she reassured him
lightly. &ldquo;Where on earth have you kept yourself
these last weeks? One sees you no more among the
haunts of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, in the deplorable argot of the hour: &ldquo;Oh,
I&rsquo;m off all that social stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not social stuff, am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve meant to call you up. Something always
seems to happen&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know, Elorn, but ever since
I came back from France I haven&rsquo;t been up to seeing
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at him curiously.</p>
<p>He sat gazing out of the window, where there was
nothing to see except leafless trees and faded grass
and starlings and dingy sparrows.</p>
<p>The girl was more worth his attention&ndash;&ndash;one of those
New York examples, built on lean, rangy, thoroughbred
lines&ndash;&ndash;long limbed, small of hand and foot and head,
with cinder-blond hair, greyish eyes, a sweet but too
generous mouth, and several noticeable freckles.</p>
<p>Minute grooming and a sure taste gave her that
ultra-smart appearance which does everything for a
type that is less attractive in a dinner gown, and still
less in neglig&eacute;e. And which, after marriage, usually
lets a straight strand of hair sprawl across one ear.</p>
<p>But now, coiffeur, milliner, modiste, and her own
maiden cleverness kept her immaculate&ndash;&ndash;the true
Gotham model found nowhere else.</p>
<p>They chatted of parties already past, where he had
failed to materialise, and of parties to come, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
she hoped he would appear. And he said he would.</p>
<p>They chatted about their friends and the gossip
concerning them.</p>
<p>Traffic on Fifth Avenue was rather worse than usual.
The competent police did their best, but motors and
omnibuses, packed solidly, moved only by short spurts
before being checked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s after one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she said, glancing at her
tiny platinum wrist-watch. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Delmonico&rsquo;s, Jim.
Shall we lunch together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He experienced a second&rsquo;s odd hesitation, then: &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;
he said. And she signalled the chauffeur.</p>
<p>The place was beginning to be crowded, but there
was a table on the Fifth Avenue side.</p>
<p>As they crossed the crowded room toward it, women
looked up at Elorn Sharrow, instantly aware that
they saw perfection in hat, gown and fur, and a face
and figure not to be mistaken for any imitation of
the Gotham type.</p>
<p>She wore silver fox&ndash;&ndash;just a stole and muff. Every
feminine eye realised their worth.</p>
<p>When they were seated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;some consomm&eacute; and a
salad. You, of course, require the usual nourishment
of the carnivora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it seemed not. However, he ordered a high-ball,
feeling curiously depressed. Then he addressed himself
to making the hour agreeable, conscious, probably,
that reparation was overdue.</p>
<p>Friends from youthful dancing-class days, these two
had plenty to gossip about; and gradually he found
himself drifting back into the lively, refreshing, piquant
intimacy of yesterday. And realised that it was very
welcome.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>For, about this girl, always a clean breeze seemed
to be blowing; and the atmosphere invariably braced
him up.</p>
<p>And she was always responsive, whether or not
agreeing with his views; and he was usually conscious
of being at his best with her. Which means much to
any man.</p>
<p>So she dissected her pear-salad, and he enjoyed his
whitebait, and they chatted away on the old footing,
quite oblivious of people around them.</p>
<p>Elorn was having a very happy time of it. People
thought her captivating now&ndash;&ndash;freckles, mouth and all&ndash;&ndash;and
every man there envied the fortunate young
fellow who was receiving such undivided attention from
a girl like this.</p>
<p>But whether in Elorn&rsquo;s heart there really existed
all the gaiety that laughed at him out of her grey
eyes, is a question. Because it seemed to her that, at
moments, a recurrent shadow fell across his face. And
there were, now and then, seconds suggesting preoccupation
on his part, when it seemed to her that his
gaze grew remote and his smile a trifle absent-minded.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She was drawing on her gloves; he had scribbled
his signature across the back of the check. Then, as
he lifted his head to look for their waiter, he found
himself staring into the brown eyes of Palla Dumont.</p>
<p>The heavy flush burnt his face&ndash;&ndash;burnt into it, so
it seemed to him.</p>
<p>She was only two tables distant. When he bowed,
her smile was the slightest; her nod coolly self-possessed.
She was wearing orchids. There seemed to
be a girl with her whom he did not know.</p>
<p>Why the sudden encounter should have upset him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
so&ndash;&ndash;why the quiet glance Elorn bestowed upon Palla
should have made him more uncomfortable still, he
could not understand.</p>
<p>He lighted a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderfully pretty girl,&rdquo; said Elorn serenely.
&ldquo;I mean the girl you bowed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is very charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met her on the steamer coming back. She is a
Miss Dumont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elorn&rsquo;s smile was a careless dismissal of further
interest. But in her heart perplexity and curiosity
contended with concern. For she had seen Jim&rsquo;s face.
And had wondered.</p>
<p>He laid away his half-consumed cigarette. She was
quite ready to go. She rose, and he laid the stole
around her shoulders. She picked up her muff.</p>
<p>As she passed through the narrow aisle, she permitted
herself a casual side-glance at this girl in black;
and Palla looked up at her, kept her quietly in range
of her brown eyes to the limit of breeding, then her
glance dropped as Jim passed; and he heard her
speaking serenely to the girl beside her.</p>
<p>At the revolving doors, Elorn said: &ldquo;Shall I drop
you at the office, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks&ndash;&ndash;if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the car he talked continually, not very entertainingly,
but there was more vivacity about him than
there had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you doing anything to-night?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>She was, of course. Yet, she felt oddly relieved
that he had asked her.... But the memory of
the strange expression in his face persisted in her mind.</p>
<p>Who was this girl with whom he had crossed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
ocean? And why should he lose his self-possession on
unexpectedly encountering her?</p>
<p>Had there been anything about Palla&ndash;&ndash;the faintest
hint of inferiority of any sort&ndash;&ndash;Elorn Sharrow could
have dismissed the episode with proud, if troubled,
philosophy. For many among her girl friends had
cub brothers. And the girl had learned that men are
men&ndash;&ndash;sometimes even the nicest&ndash;&ndash;although she could
not understand it.</p>
<p>But this brown-eyed girl in black was evidently her
own sort&ndash;&ndash;Jim&rsquo;s sort. And that preoccupied her; and
she lent only an inattentive ear to the animated monologue
of the man beside her.</p>
<p>Before the offices of Sharrow &amp; Co. her car stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Jim,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m so busy this
week. But we ought to meet at many places, unless
you continue to play the recluse. Don&rsquo;t you really
go anywhere any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; he said bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do. And call me up sometimes. Take a
sporting chance whenever you&rsquo;re free. We ought to
get in an hour together now and then. You&rsquo;re coming
to my dance of course, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled in her sweet, generous way and gave
him her hand again.</p>
<p>And he went into the office feeling rather miserable
and beginning to realise why.</p>
<p>For in spite of what he had said to Palla about
the wisdom of absenting himself, the mere sight of her
had instantly set him afire.</p>
<p>And now he wanted to see her&ndash;&ndash;needed to see her.
A day was too long to pass without seeing her. An
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
evening without her&ndash;&ndash;and another&ndash;&ndash;and others, appalled
him.</p>
<p>And all the afternoon he thought of her, his mind
scarcely on his business at all.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>His parents were dining at home. He was very
gay that evening&ndash;&ndash;very amusing in describing his misadventures
with Messrs. Puma and Skidder. But his
mother appeared to be more interested in the description
of his encounter with Elorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s such a dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you go to the
Speedwells&rsquo; dinner on Thursday you&rsquo;ll see her again.
You haven&rsquo;t declined, I hope; have you, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared that he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you drop out of things this way nobody will
bother to ask you anywhere after a while. Don&rsquo;t you
know that, dear?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This town forgets overnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, mother. I&rsquo;ll keep up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father remarked that it was part of his business
to know the sort of people who bought houses.</p>
<p>Jim agreed with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll surely kick in again,&rdquo; he
promised cheerfully.... &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go to the
club this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother smiled. It was a healthy sign. Also,
thank goodness, there were no girls in black at the club.</p>
<p>At the club he resolutely passed the telephone booths
and even got as far as the cloak room before he
hesitated.</p>
<p>Then, very slowly, he retraced his steps; went into
the nearest booth, and called a number that seemed
burnt into his brain. Palla answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you doing anything, dear?&rdquo; he asked&ndash;&ndash;his
usual salutation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; she said calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is. Who else calls you dear? May I come
around for a little while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten what you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! May I come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you speak to me so curtly, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She deliberated so long that her silence irritated
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly don&rsquo;t want you if you are likely to be
ill-tempered, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ill-tempered.... I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s
the trouble if I may come. May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anything troubling you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She herself admitted him. He laid his hat and coat
on a chair in the hall and followed her upstairs to the
living-room.</p>
<p>When she had seated herself she looked up at him
interrogatively, awaiting his pleasure. He stood a
moment with his back to the fire, his hands twisting
nervously behind him. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My trouble,&rdquo; he explained na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;is that I am
restless and unhappy when I remain away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed. &ldquo;But, Jim, you seemed to be
having a perfectly good time at Delmonico&rsquo;s this
noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reddened and gave her a disconcerted look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;why any man shouldn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
have a good time with such an attractive girl. May
I ask who she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elorn Sharrow,&rdquo; he replied bluntly.</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s glance had sometimes wandered over social
columns in the papers and periodicals, and she was not
ignorant concerning the identity and local importance
of Miss Sharrow.</p>
<p>She looked up curiously at Jim. He was so very
good to look at! Better, even, to know. And Miss
Sharrow was his kind. They had seemed to belong
together. And it came to Palla, hazily, and for the
first time, that she herself seemed to belong nowhere in
particular in the scheme of things.</p>
<p>But that was quite all right. She had now established
for herself a habitation. She had some friends&ndash;&ndash;would
undoubtedly make others. She had her interests,
her peace of mind, and her independence. And
behind her she had the dear and tragic past&ndash;&ndash;a passionate
memory of a dead girl; a terrible remembrance of
a dead God.</p>
<p>The heart of the world alone could make up to her
these losses. For now she was already preparing to
seek it in her own way, under her own Law of Love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she said almost timidly, &ldquo;I have not intended
to make you unhappy. Don&rsquo;t you understand that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seated himself: she lighted a cigarette for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you can&rsquo;t help doing it,&rdquo; he said glumly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t, it seems. I don&rsquo;t love you. I wish I
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.... I wish I were in love with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment she said: &ldquo;I told you how much I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
care for you. But&ndash;&ndash;if you think it is easier for you&ndash;&ndash;not
to see me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to stay away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;for my sake; but I&rsquo;m troubled
on your account. I do so adore to be with you! But&ndash;&ndash;but
if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it all!&rdquo; he exclaimed, forcing a wry smile.
&ldquo;I act like an unbaked fool! You&rsquo;ve gone to my head,
Palla, and I behave like a drunken kid.... I&rsquo;ll
buck up. I&rsquo;ve got to. I&rsquo;m not the blithering, balmy,
moon-eyed, melancholy ass you think me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her quick laughter rang clear, and his echoed it,
rather uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re nearest my heart
of anybody. I told you so. It&rsquo;s only that one thing
I don&rsquo;t dare do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you really understand that I&rsquo;m afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I should think you might
be, considering your astonishing point of view. I
should think you&rsquo;d be properly scared to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. No girl, afraid, should ever take such a
chance. Love and Fear cannot exist together. The
one always slays the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her curiously, remembering what
Estridge had told him about her&ndash;&ndash;how, on that terrible
day in the convent chapel, this girl&rsquo;s love had
truly slain the fear within her as she faced the Red
assassins and offered to lay down her life for her
friend. Than which, it is said, there is no greater
love....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what are you thinking?&rdquo; she asked, watching his
expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of you&ndash;&ndash;you strange, generous, fearless, wilful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
girl!&rdquo; Then he squared his shoulders and shook them
as though freeing himself of something oppressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you <i>may</i> need is a spanking!&rdquo; he suggested
coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Jim!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re not likely to get it. And what
is going to happen to you&ndash;&ndash;and to me&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;I
don&rsquo;t know, Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I prophesy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, Miriam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, then: I shall never care for any man more
than I care now for you; I shall never care more for
you than I do now.... And if you are sweet-tempered
and sensible, we shall be very happy with
each other.... Even after you marry....
Unless your wife misunderstands&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife!&rdquo; he repeated derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Sharrow, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned a dull red; the girl&rsquo;s heart missed a beat,
then hurried a little before it calmed again under her
cool recognition and instant disdain of the first twinge
of jealousy she could remember since childhood.</p>
<p>The absurdity of it, too! After all, it was this
man&rsquo;s destiny to marry. And, if it chanced to be that
girl&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said in a detached, musing way, &ldquo;it
is well for you to remember that I shall never marry
unless I marry you.... Life is long. There are
other women.... I may forget you&ndash;&ndash;at intervals....
But I shall never marry except with
you, Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her smile forced the gravity from her lips and eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you behave like a veiled prophet you&rsquo;ll end by
scaring me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>But he merely gathered her into his arms and kissed
her&ndash;&ndash;laid back her head and looked down into her face
and kissed her lips, without haste, as though she belonged
to him.</p>
<p>Her head rested quite motionless on his shoulder.
Perhaps she was still too taken aback to do anything
about the matter. Her heart had hurried a little&ndash;&ndash;not
much&ndash;&ndash;stimulated, possibly, by the rather agreeable
curiosity which invaded her&ndash;&ndash;charmingly expressive,
now, in her wide brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way of it,&rdquo; he concluded, still looking
down at her. &ldquo;There are other women in the world.
And life is long. But I marry you or nobody. And
it&rsquo;s my opinion that I shall not die unmarried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to think much of my opinions,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you more friendly to mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain opinions of yours,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;originated
in the diseased bean of some crazy Russian&ndash;&ndash;never
in your mind! So of course I hold them in contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw his face darken, watched it a moment, then
impulsively drew his head down against hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do care for your opinions,&rdquo; she said, her cheek,
delicately warm, beside his. &ldquo;So, even if you can not
comprehend mine, be generous to them. I&rsquo;m sincere. I
try to be honest. If you differ from me, do it kindly,
not contemptuously. For there is no such thing as
&lsquo;noble contempt!&rsquo; There is respectability in anger and
nobility in tolerance. But none in disdain, for they
are contradictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I despise and hate this loose
socialistic philosophy that makes a bonfire of everything
the world believes in!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hate other creeds; merely conform to your
own, Jim. It will keep you very, very busy. And give
others a chance to live up to their beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt the smile on her lips and cheek:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t live up to my belief if I marry you,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;So let us care for each other peacefully&ndash;&ndash;accepting
each other as we are. Life is long, as you say....
And there are other women.... And
ultimately you will marry one of them. But until
then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt her lips very lightly against his&ndash;&ndash;cool young
lips, still and fragrant and sweet.</p>
<p>After a moment she asked him to release her; and
she rose and walked across the room to the mirror.</p>
<p>Still busy with her hair, she turned partly toward
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apropos of nothing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a man was exceedingly
impudent to me on the street this evening. A
Russian, too. I was so annoyed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened just as I started to ascend the steps.... There
was a man there, loitering. I supposed
he meant to beg. So I felt for my purse, but he jumped
back and began to curse me roundly for an aristocrat
and a social parasite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so amazed&ndash;&ndash;quite stupefied. And all the while
he was swearing at me in Russian and in English, and
he warned me to keep away from Marya and Vanya
and Ilse and mind my own damned business. And he
said, also, that if I didn&rsquo;t there were people in New
York who knew how to deal with any friend of the
Russian aristocracy.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>She patted a curly strand of hair into place, and
came toward him in her leisurely, lissome way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy the impertinence of that wretched Red! And
I understand that both Vanya and Marya have received
horribly insulting letters. And Ilse, also. Isn&rsquo;t it
most annoying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seated herself at the piano and absently began
the Adagio of the famous sonata.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>There was still, for Palla, much shopping to do.
The drawing room she decided to leave, for the
present, caring as she did only for a few genuine
and beautiful pieces to furnish the pretty little French
grey room.</p>
<p>The purchase of these ought to be deferred, but she
could look about, and she did, wandering into antique
shops of every class along Fifth and Madison Avenues
and the inviting cross streets.</p>
<p>But her chiefest quest was still for pots and pans
and china; for napery, bed linen, and hangings; also
for her own and more intimate personal attire.</p>
<p>To her the city was enchanting and not at all as she
remembered it before she had gone abroad.</p>
<p>New York, under its canopy of tossing flags and
ablaze with brilliant posters, swarmed with unfamiliar
people. Every other pedestrian seemed to be a soldier;
every other vehicle contained a uniform.</p>
<p>There were innumerable varieties of military dress in
the thronged streets; there was the universal note of
khaki and olive drab, terminating in leather vizored
barrack cap or jaunty overseas service cap, and in
spiral puttees, leather ones, or spurred boots.</p>
<p>Silver wings of aviators glimmered on athletic
chests; chevrons, wound stripes, service stripes, an endless
variety of insignia.</p>
<p>Here the grey-green and oxidised metal of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
marines predominated; there, the conspicuous sage-green
and gold of naval aviators. On campaign hats
were every hue of hat cord; the rich gilt and blue of
naval officers and the blue and white of their jackies
were everywhere to be encountered.</p>
<p>And then everywhere, also, the brighter hue and
exotic cut of foreign uniforms was apparent&ndash;&ndash;splashes
of gayer tints amid khaki and sober civilian garb&ndash;&ndash;the
beautiful <i>garance</i> and horizon-blue of French officers;
the familiar &ldquo;brass hat&rdquo; of the British; the grey-blue
and maroon of Italians. And there were stranger
uniforms in varieties inexhaustible&ndash;&ndash;the schapska-shaped
head-gear of Polish officers, the beret of Czecho-Slovaks.
And everywhere, too, the gay and well-known
red pom-pon bobbed on the caps of French blue-jackets,
and British marines stalked in pairs, looking every
inch the soldier with their swagger sticks and their
vizorless forage-caps.</p>
<p>Always, it seemed to Palla, there was military music
to be heard above the roar of traffic&ndash;&ndash;sometimes the
drums and bugles of foreign detachments, arrived in
aid of &ldquo;drives&rdquo; and loans of various sorts.</p>
<p>Ambulances painted grey and bright blue, and
driven by smartly uniformed young women, were everywhere.</p>
<p>And to women&rsquo;s uniforms there seemed no end, ranging
all the way from the sober blue of the army nurse
and the pretty white of the Red Cross, to bizarre but
smart effects carried smartly by well set up girls representing
scores of service corps, some invaluable, some
of doubtful utility.</p>
<p>Eagle huts, canteens, soldiers&rsquo; rest houses, Red
Cross quarters, clubs, temporary barracks, peppered
the city. Everywhere the service flags were visible,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
also, telling their proud stories in five-pointed symbols&ndash;&ndash;sometimes
tragic, where gold stars glittered.</p>
<p>Never had New York seemed to contain so many
people; never had the overflow so congested avenue
and street, circle and square, and the wretchedly inadequate
and dirty street-car and subway service.</p>
<p>And into the heart of it all went Palla, engulfed in
the great tides of Fifth Avenue, drifting into quieter
back-waters to east and west, and sometimes caught
and tossed about in the glittering maelstrom of Broadway
when she ventured into the theatre district.</p>
<p>Opera, comedy, musical show and cinema interested
her; restaurant and cabaret she had evaded, so far,
but what most excited and fascinated her was the people
themselves&ndash;&ndash;these eager, restless moving millions
swarming through the city day and night, always in
motion under blue skies or falling rain, perpetually in
quest of what the world eternally offered, eternally
concealed&ndash;&ndash;that indefinite, glimmering thing called
&ldquo;heart&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To discover, to comprehend, to help, to guide their
myriad aspirations in the interminable and headlong
hunt for happiness, was, to Palla, the most vital problem
in the world.</p>
<p>For her there existed only one solution of this problem:
the Law of Love.</p>
<p>And in this world-wide Hunt for Happiness, where
scrambling millions followed the trail of Heart&rsquo;s Desire,
she saw the mad huntsman, Folly, leading, and
Black Care, the whipper-in; and, at the bitter end,
only the bones of the world&rsquo;s woe; and a Horseman
seated on his Pale Horse.</p>
<p>But the problem that still remained was how to
swerve the headlong hunt to the true trail toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
only goal where the world&rsquo;s quarry, happiness, lies
asleep.</p>
<p>How to make service the Universal Heart&rsquo;s Desire?
How to transfigure self-love into Love?</p>
<p>To preach her faith from the street corners&ndash;&ndash;to cry
it aloud in the wilderness where no ear heeded&ndash;&ndash;violence,
aggression, the campaign militant, had never
appealed to the girl.</p>
<p>Like her nation, only when cornered did she blaze
out and strike. But to harangue, threaten, demand
of the world that it accept the Law of Service and of
Love, seemed to her a mockery of the faith she had
embraced, which, unless irrevocably in liaison with freedom,
was no faith at all.</p>
<p>So, for Palla, the solution lay in loyalty to the faith
she professed; in living it; in swaying ignorance by
example; in overcoming incredulity by service, scepticism
by love.</p>
<p>Love and Service? Why, all around her among these
teeming millions were examples&ndash;&ndash;volunteers in khaki,
their sisters in the garments of mercy! Why must the
world stop there? This was the right scent. Why
should the hunt swerve for the devil&rsquo;s herring drawn
across the trail?</p>
<p>One for all; all for one! She had read it on one of
the war-posters. Somebody had taken the splendid
Guardsman&rsquo;s creed and had made it the slogan for this
war against darkness.</p>
<p>And that was her creed&ndash;&ndash;the true faith&ndash;&ndash;the Law of
Love. Then, was it good only in war? Why not make
it the nation&rsquo;s creed? Why not emblazon it on the
wall of every city on earth?&ndash;&ndash;one for all; all for one;
Love, Service, Freedom!</p>
<p>Before such a faith, autocracy and tyranny die.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Under such a law every evil withers, every question is
unravelled. There are no more problems of poverty
and riches, none of greed and oppression.</p>
<p>The tyranny of convention, of observance, of taboo,
of folkways, ends. And into the brain of all living
beings will be born the perfect comprehension of their
own indestructible divinity.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Part of this she ventured to say to Ilse Westgard
one day, when they had met for luncheon in a modest
tea-room on Forty-third Street.</p>
<p>But Ilse, always inclined toward militancy, did not
entirely agree with Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To embody in one&rsquo;s daily life the principles of one&rsquo;s
living faith is scarcely sufficient,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good is a
force, not an inert condition. So is evil. And we
should not sit still while evil moves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Example is not inertia,&rdquo; protested Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Example, alone, is sterile, I think,&rdquo; said the ex-girl-soldier
of the Battalion of Death, buttering a crescent.
She ate it with the delightful appetite of flawless
health, and poured out more chocolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance, dear,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;the forces of evil&ndash;&ndash;of
degeneration, ignorance, envy, ferocity, are gathering
like a tornado in Russia. Virtuous example,
sucking its thumbs and minding its own business, will
be torn to fragments when the storm breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bolsheviki?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Reds. The Terrorists, I mean. You know as
well as I do what they really are&ndash;&ndash;merely looters skulking
through the smoke of a world in flames&ndash;&ndash;buzzards
on the carcass of a civilisation dead. But, Palla, they
do not sit still and suck their thumbs and say, &lsquo;I am a
Terrorist. Behold me and be converted.&rsquo; No, indeed!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
They are moving, always in motion, preoccupied by
their hellish designs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Russia, yes,&rdquo; admitted Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everywhere, dearest. Here, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe there are scarcely any in America,&rdquo; insisted
Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country crawls with them,&rdquo; retorted Ilse.
&ldquo;They work like moles, but already if you look about
you can see the earth stirring above their tunnels.
They are here, everywhere, active, scheming, plotting,
whispering treason, stirring discontent, inciting envy,
teaching treason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the Russians&ndash;&ndash;Christians and Jews&ndash;&ndash;who
have filtered in here to do the nation mischief. They
are the Germans who blew up factories, set fires, scuttled
ships. They are foreigners who came here
poisoned with envy; who have acquired nothing; whose
greed and ferocity are whetted and ready for a universal
conflagration by which they alone could profit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the labour leaders who break faith and
incite to violence; they are the I. W. W.; they are the
Black Hand, the Camorra; they are the penniless who
would slay and rob; the landless who would kill and
seize; the ignorant, nursing suspicion; the shiftless,
brooding crimes to bring them riches quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Palla, your Law of Love and Service is good.
But not for these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What law for them, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Education. Maybe with machine guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla shook her head. &ldquo;Is that the way to educate
defectives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they come at you <i>en masse</i>, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla laughed. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
nation-wide Terrorist plot. These mental defectives
are not in mass anywhere in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in dangerous groups everywhere. And
every group is devoting its cunning to turning the
working masses into a vast mob of the Black Hundred!
They did it in Russia. They are working for it all
over the world. You do not believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Ilse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. You shall come with me this evening.
Are you busy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of Jim glimmered in her mind. He
might feel aggrieved. But he ought to begin to realise
that he couldn&rsquo;t be with her every evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t any plans, Ilse,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no definite
engagement, I mean. Will you dine at home with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early, then. Because there is a meeting which you
and I shall attend. It is an education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An anarchist meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Reds. I think we should go&ndash;&ndash;perhaps take
part&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? I shall not listen to lies and remain
silent!&rdquo; said Ilse, laughing. &ldquo;The Revolution was
good. But the Bolsheviki are nothing but greedy
thieves and murderers. You and I know that. If
anybody teaches people the contrary, I certainly shall
have something to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla desired to purchase silk for sofa pillows, having
acquired a chaise-longue for her bedroom.</p>
<p>So she and Ilse went out into the sunshine and multi-coloured
crowd; and all the afternoon they shopped
very blissfully&ndash;&ndash;which meant, also, lingering before
store windows, drifting into picture-galleries, taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
tea at Sherry&rsquo;s, and finally setting out for home
through a beflagged avenue jammed with traffic.</p>
<p>Dusk fell early but the drooping, orange-tinted
globes which had replaced the white ones on the Fifth
Avenue lamps were not yet lighted; and there still remained
a touch of sunset in the sky when they left the
bus.</p>
<p>At the corner of Palla&rsquo;s street, there seemed to be
an unusual congestion, and now, above the noise of
traffic, they caught the sound of a band; and turned
at the curb to see, supposing it to be a military music.</p>
<p>The band was a full one, not military, wearing a
slatternly sort of uniform but playing well enough as
they came up through the thickening dusk, marching
close to the eastern curb of the avenue.</p>
<p>They were playing <i>The Marseillaise</i>. Four abreast,
behind them, marched a dingy column of men and
women, mostly of foreign aspect and squatty build,
carrying a flag which seemed to be entirely red.</p>
<p>Palla, perplexed, incredulous, yet almost instantly
suspecting the truth, stared at the rusty ranks, at the
knots of red ribbon on every breast.</p>
<p>Other people were staring, too, as the unexpected
procession came shuffling along&ndash;&ndash;late shoppers, business
men returning home, soldiers&ndash;&ndash;all paused to gaze
at this sullen visaged battalion clumping up the avenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Palla to Ilse, &ldquo;these people can&rsquo;t be
Reds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely they are!&rdquo; returned the tall, fair girl calmly.
Her face had become flushed, and she stepped to the
edge of the curb, her blue, wrathful eyes darkening
like sapphires.</p>
<p>A soldier came up beside her. Others, sailors and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
soldiers, stopped to look. There was a red flag passing.
Suddenly Ilse stepped from the sidewalk,
wrenched the flag from the burly Jew who carried it,
and, with the same movement, shattered the staff across
her knee.</p>
<p>Men and women in the ranks closed in on her; a
shrill roar rose from them, but the soldiers and sailors,
cheering and laughing, broke into the enraged ranks,
tearing off red rosettes, cuffing and kicking the infuriated
Terrorists, seizing every seditious banner, flag,
emblem and placard in sight.</p>
<p>Female Reds, shrieking with rage, clawed, kicked and
bit at soldier, sailor and civilian. A gaunt man, with a
greasy bunch of hair under a bowler, waved dirty
hands above the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e and shouted that he had the
Mayor&rsquo;s permission to parade.</p>
<p>Everywhere automobiles were stopping, crowds of
people hurrying up, policemen running. The electric
lights snapped alight, revealed a mob struggling there
in the yellowish glare.</p>
<p>Ilse had calmly stepped to the sidewalk, the fragments
of flag and staff in her white-gloved hands; and,
as she saw the irresponsible soldiers and blue-jackets
wading lustily into the Reds&ndash;&ndash;saw the lively riot which
her own action had started&ndash;&ndash;an irresistible desire to
laugh seized her.</p>
<p>Clear and gay above the yelling of Bolsheviki and
the &ldquo;Yip&ndash;&ndash;yip!&rdquo; of the soldiers, peeled her infectious
laughter. But Palla, more gentle, stood with dark eyes
dilated, fearful of real bloodshed in the furious scene
raging in the avenue before her.</p>
<p>A little shrimp of a Terrorist, a huge red rosette
streaming from his buttonhole, suddenly ran at Ilse
and seized the broken staff and the rags of the red flag.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
And Palla, alarmed, caught him by the coat-collar
and dragged him screeching and cursing away from her
friend, rebuking him in a firm but excited voice.</p>
<p>Ilse came over, shouldering her superb figure through
the crowd; looked at the human shrimp a moment; then
her laughter pealed anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man who abused me in Denmark!&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Oh, Palla, <i>look</i> at him! Do you really believe
you could educate a thing like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man had wriggled free, and now he turned a
flat, whiskered visage on Palla, menaced her with both
soiled fists, inarticulate in his fury.</p>
<p>But police were everywhere, now, sweeping this miniature
riot from the avenue, hustling the Reds uptown,
checking the skylarking soldiery, sending amused or
indignant citizens about their business.</p>
<p>A burly policeman said to Ilse with a grin: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take what&rsquo;s left of that red flag, Miss;&rdquo; and the girl
handed it to him still laughing.</p>
<p>Soldiers wearing overseas caps cheered her and Palla.
Everybody on the turbulent sidewalk was now laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;yeh see that blond nab the red flag outer that
big kike&rsquo;s fists?&rdquo; shouted one soldier to his sweating
bunkie. &ldquo;Some skirt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God love the Bolsheviki she grabs by the slack o&rsquo;
the pants!&rdquo; cried a blue-jacket who had lost his cap.
A roar followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one flag in this little old town!&rdquo; yelled a
citizen nursing a cut cheek with reddened handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;wan, now!&rdquo; grumbled a policeman, trying to look
severe; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all over; they&rsquo;s nothing to see. Av ye
got homes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yip! Where do we go from here?&rdquo; demanded a
marine.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; repeated the policeman; &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s the
answer. G&rsquo;wan, now, peaceable&ndash;&ndash;lave these ladies
pass!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse and Palla, still walled in by a grinning, admiring
soldiery, took advantage of the opening and fled, followed
by cheers as far as Palla&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Ilse,&rdquo; she exclaimed in fresh dismay,
as she began to realise the rather violent r&ocirc;les they both
had played, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;is that your idea of education for the
masses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant answered the bell and they entered the
house. And presently, seated on the chaise-longue in
Palla&rsquo;s bedroom, Ilse Westgard alternately gazed upon
her ruined white gloves and leaned against the cane
back, weak with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny! How degrading! But how funny!&rdquo;
she kept repeating. &ldquo;That large and enraged Jew with
the red flag!&ndash;&ndash;the wretched little Christian shrimp you
carried wriggling away by the collar! Oh, Palla!
Palla! Never shall I forget the expression on your
face&ndash;&ndash;like a bored housewife, who, between thumb and
forefinger, carries a dead mouse by the tail&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was trying to kick you, my dear,&rdquo; explained
Palla, beginning to remove the hairpins from her hair.</p>
<p>Ilse touched her eyes with her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might have thrown bombs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all very well to laugh, darling, but sometimes such
affairs are not funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla, seated at her dresser, shook down a mass of
thick, bright-brown hair, and picked up her comb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am wondering,&rdquo; she said, turning partly toward
Ilse, &ldquo;what Jim Shotwell would think of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fighting on the street!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;her laughter rang out
uncontrolled. And Palla, too, was laughing rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
uncertainly, for, as her recollection of the affair became
more vivid, her doubts concerning the entire procedure
increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that red flag was outrageous,
and you were quite right in destroying it. One could
hardly buttonhole such a procession and try to educate
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse said: &ldquo;One can usually educate a wild animal,
but never a rabid one. You&rsquo;ll see, to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to a place just west of Seventh
Avenue, called the Red Flag Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a club?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The Reds hire it several times a week and
try to fill it with people. There is the menace to this
city and to the nation, Palla&ndash;&ndash;for these cunning fomenters
of disorder deluge the poorer quarters of the
town with their literature. That&rsquo;s where they get
their audiences. And that is where are being born the
seeds of murder and destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla, combing out her hair, gazed absently into
the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should not we do the same thing?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Form a club, rent a room, and talk to people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; why not?&rdquo; asked Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly why I wish you to come with me
to-night&ndash;&ndash;to realise how we should combat these criminal
and insane agents of all that is most terrible in
Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are right, Palla; that is the way to fight
them. That is the way to neutralise the poison they
are spreading. That is the way to educate the masses
to that sane socialism in which we both believe. It can
be done by education. It can be done by matching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
them with club for club, meeting for meeting, speech
for speech. And when, in some local instances, it can
not be done that way, then, if there be disorder, force!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be done entirely by education,&rdquo; said Palla.
&ldquo;But remember!&ndash;&ndash;Marx gave the forces of disorder
their slogan&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;Unite!&rsquo; Only a rigid organisation of
sane civilisation can meet that menace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very right, darling, and a club to combat
the Bolsheviki already exists. Vanya and Marya
already have joined; there are workmen and working
women, college professors and college graduates among
its members. Some, no doubt, will be among the audience
at the Red Flag Club to-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall join this club. I think you, also, will wish
to enroll. It is called only &lsquo;Number One.&rsquo; Other
clubs are to be organised and numbered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you see that, in America, the fight against
organised rascality and exploited insanity has really
begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla, her hair under discipline once more, donned
a fresh but severe black gown. Ilse unpinned her
hat, made a vigorous toilet, then lighted a cigarette
and sauntered into the living room where the telephone
was ringing persistently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please answer,&rdquo; said Palla, fastening her gown
before the pier glass.</p>
<p>Presently Ilse called her: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Shotwell, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla came into the room and picked up the receiver:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Oh, good evening, Jim! Yes.... Yes,
I am going out with Ilse.... Why, no, I had no
engagement with you, Jim! I&rsquo;m sorry, but I didn&rsquo;t
understand&ndash;&ndash;No; I had no idea that you expected to
see me&ndash;&ndash;wait a moment, please!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she put one hand
over the transmitter, turned to Ilse with flushed cheeks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
and a shyly interrogative smile: &ldquo;Shall I ask him to
dine with us and go with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you choose,&rdquo; called Ilse, faintly amused.</p>
<p>Then Palla called him: &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;Jim! Come to dinner at
once. And wear your business clothes.... What?... Yes,
your every day clothes.... What?... Why,
because I ask you, Jim. Isn&rsquo;t
that a reason?... Thank you.... Yes,
come immediately.... Good-bye, de&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She coloured crimson, hung up the receiver, and
picked up the evening paper, not daring to glance at
Ilse.</p>
<div class='chsp'>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>When Shotwell arrived, dinner had already
been announced, and Palla and Ilse Westgard
were in the unfurnished drawing-room, the
former on a step-ladder, the latter holding that collapsible
machine with one hand and Palla&rsquo;s ankle with
the other.</p>
<p>Palla waved a tape-measure in airy salute: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
trying to find out how many yards it takes for my
curtains,&rdquo; she explained. But she climbed down and
gave him her hand; and they went immediately into
the dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this nonsense about the Red Flag Club?&rdquo;
he inquired, when they were seated. &ldquo;Do you and Ilse
really propose going to that dirty anarchist joint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it&rsquo;s dirty?&rdquo; demanded Palla,
&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;or do you mean it&rsquo;s only morally dingy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both she and Ilse appeared to be in unusually
lively spirits, and they poked fun at him when he objected
to their attending the meeting in question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there may be a free fight.
There was a row on Fifth Avenue this evening, where
some of those rats were parading with red flags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla laughed and cast a demure glance at Ilse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there to laugh at?&rdquo; demanded Jim. &ldquo;There
was a small riot on Fifth Avenue! I met several men
at the club who witnessed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sea-blue eyes of Ilse were full of mischief. He
was aware of Palla&rsquo;s subtle exhilaration, too.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why hunt for a free fight?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why avoid one if it&rsquo;s free?&rdquo; retorted Ilse, gaily.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your idea of liberty?&rdquo; he asked Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is all human progress but a free fight?&rdquo; she
retorted. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;Ilse means an
intellectual battle. If they misbehave otherwise, I shall
flee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you want to go to hear a lot of
Reds talk bosh,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t like you,
Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> like me. You see you don&rsquo;t really know me,
Jim,&rdquo; she added with smiling malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main thing,&rdquo; said Ilse, &ldquo;is for one to be one&rsquo;s
self. Palla and I are social revolutionists. Revolutionists
revolt. A revolt is a row. There can be
no row unless people fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled at their irresponsible gaiety, a little puzzled
by it and a little uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, as coffee was served; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
just as well that I&rsquo;m going with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ex-girl-soldier gave him an amused glance,
lighted a cigarette, glanced at her wrist-watch, then
rose lightly to her graceful, athletic height, saying
that they ought to start.</p>
<p>So they went away to pin on their hats, and Jim
called a taxi.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The hall was well filled when they arrived. There
was a rostrum, on which two wooden benches faced a
table and a chair in the centre. On the table stood
a pitcher of drinking water, a soiled glass, and a jug
full of red carnations.</p>
<p>A dozen men and women occupied the two benches.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
At the table a man sat writing. He held a lighted
cigar in one hand; a red silk handkerchief trailed from
his coat pocket.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>As Ilse and Palla seated themselves on an empty
bench and Shotwell found a place beside them, somebody
on the next bench beyond leaned over and bade
them good evening in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brisson!&rdquo; exclaimed Palla, giving him her hand
in unfeigned pleasure.</p>
<p>Brisson shook hands, also, with Ilse, cordially, and
then was introduced to Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he inquired humorously
of Palla. &ldquo;And, by the way,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;dropping his
voice&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;these Reds don&rsquo;t exactly love me, so don&rsquo;t
use my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla nodded and whispered to Jim: &ldquo;He secured all
that damning evidence at the Smolny for our Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brisson and Ilse were engaged in low-voiced conversation:
Palla ventured to look about her.</p>
<p>The character of the gathering was foreign. There
were few American features among the faces, but those
few were immeasurably superior in type&ndash;&ndash;here and
there the intellectual, spectacled visage of some educated
visionary, lured into the red tide and left there drifting;&ndash;&ndash;here
and there some pale girl, carelessly dressed,
seated with folded hands, and intense gaze fixed on
space.</p>
<p>But the majority of these people, men and women,
were foreign in aspect&ndash;&ndash;round, bushy heads with no
backs to them were everywhere; muddy skins, unhealthy
skins, loose mouths, shifty eyes!&ndash;&ndash;everywhere around
her Palla saw the stigma of degeneracy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>She said in a low voice to Jim: &ldquo;These poor things
need to be properly housed and fed before they&rsquo;re
taught. Education doesn&rsquo;t interest empty stomachs.
And when they&rsquo;re given only poison to stop the pangs&ndash;&ndash;what
does civilisation expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a lot of bums. The only education
they require is with a night-stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cruel, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of your laws which does not appeal to me,&rdquo;
she remarked, turning to Brisson, who was leaning
over to speak to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are half a dozen plain-clothes men in the
audience,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are Government detectives
here, too. I rather expect they&rsquo;ll stop the proceedings
before the programme calls for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim turned to look back. A file of policemen entered
and carelessly took up posts in the rear of the
hall. Hundreds of flat-backed heads turned, too; hundreds
of faces darkened; a low muttering arose from
the benches.</p>
<p>Then the man at the table on the rostrum got up
abruptly, and pulled out his red handkerchief as though
to wipe his face.</p>
<p>At the sudden flourish of the red fabric, a burst of
applause came from the benches. Orator and audience
were <i>en rapport</i>; the former continued to wave the
handkerchief, under pretence of swabbing his features,
but the intention was so evident and the applause so enlightening
that a police officer came part way down
the aisle and held up a gilded sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he called in a bored voice, &ldquo;Cut that out!
See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man on the platform is Max Sondheim,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
whispered Brisson. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll skate on thin ice before he&rsquo;s
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sondheim had already begun to speak, ignoring the
interruption from the police:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mayor has got cold feet,&rdquo; he said with a sneer.
&ldquo;He gave us a permit to parade, but when the soldiers
attacked us his police clubbed us. That&rsquo;s the kind of
government we got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; cried a white-faced girl in the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame?&rdquo; repeated Sondheim ironically. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
shame to a cop? They got theirs all the same&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; shouted the police captain sharply.
&ldquo;Any more of that and I&rsquo;ll run you in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sondheim&rsquo;s red-rimmed eyes measured the officer in
silence for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the privilege,&rdquo; he said to his audience, &ldquo;of
introducing to you our comrade, Professor Le Vey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le Vey,&rdquo; whispered Brisson in Palla&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a crack-brained chemist, and they ought to nab him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor rose from one of the benches on the
rostrum and came forward&ndash;&ndash;a tall, black-bearded man,
deathly pale, whose protruding, bluish eyes seemed
almost stupid in their fixity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words are by-products,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and of minor
importance. Deeds educate. T. N. T., also, is a byproduct,
and of no use in conversation unless employed
as an argument&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; A roar of applause drowned his
voice: he gazed at the audience out of his stupid pop-eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tyranny has kicked you into the gutter,&rdquo; he went
on. &ldquo;Capital makes laws to keep you there and hires
police and soldiers to enforce those laws. This is
called civilisation. Is there anything for you to do
except to pick yourselves out of the gutter and destroy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
what kicked you into it and what keeps you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; roared the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a clean sweep will do it,&rdquo; said Le Vey. &ldquo;If
you have a single germ of plague in the world, it will
multiply. If you leave a single trace of what is called
civilisation in the world, it will hatch out more tyrants,
more capitalists, more laws. So there is only one remedy.
Destruction. Total annihilation. Nothing less
can purify this rotten hell they call the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid storms of applause he unrolled a manuscript
and read without emphasis:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, the Workers of the World, in council
assembled, hereby proclaim at midnight to-night,
throughout the entire world:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. That all debts, public and private, are cancelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. That all leases, contracts, indentures and similar
instruments, products of capitalism, are null and
void.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. All statutes, ordinances and other enactments
of capitalist government are repealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4. All public offices are declared vacant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5. The military and naval organisations will immediately
dissolve and reorganise themselves upon a
democratic basis for speedy mobilisation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6. All working classes and political prisoners will
be immediately freed and all indictments quashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;7. All vacant and unused land shall immediately
revert to the people and remain common property until
suitable regulations for its disposition can be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;8. All telephones, telegraphs, cables, railroads,
steamship lines and other means of communication and
transportation shall be immediately taken over by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
workers and treated henceforth as the property of the
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;9. As speedily as possible the workers in the various
industries will proceed to take over these industries
and organise them in the spirit of the new epoch now
beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;10. The flag of the new society shall be plain red,
marking our unity and brotherhood with similar republics
in Russia, Germany, Austria and elsewhere&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be about all from you, Professor,&rdquo; interrupted
the police captain, strolling down to the platform.
&ldquo;Come on, now. Kiss your friends good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sullen roar rose from the audience; Le Vey lifted
one hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you how to argue,&rdquo; he said in his emotionless
voice. &ldquo;Anybody can talk with their mouths.&rdquo; And
he turned on his heel and went back to his seat on the
bench.</p>
<p>Sondheim stood up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comrade Bromberg!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>A small, shabby man arose from a bench and shambled
forward. His hair grew so low that it left him
practically no forehead. Whiskers blotted out the remainder
of his features except two small and very
bright eyes that snapped and sparkled, imbedded in
the hairy ensemble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;it has come to a moment
when the only law worth obeying is the law of
force!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; remarked the police captain, genially,
and, turning his back, he walked away up the aisle
toward the rear of the hall, while all around him from
the audience came a savage muttering.</p>
<p>Bromberg&rsquo;s growling voice grew harsher and deeper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
as he resumed: &ldquo;I tell you that there is only one law
left for proletariat and tyrant alike! It is the law
of force!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the audience applauded fiercely, a man near them
stood up and shouted for a hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comrade Bromberg is right!&rdquo; he cried, waving his
arms excitedly. &ldquo;There is only one real law in the
world! The fit survive! The unfit die! The strong
take what they desire! The weak perish. That is the
law of life! That is the&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An amazing interruption checked him&ndash;&ndash;a clear, crystalline
peal of laughter; and the astounded audience
saw a tall, fresh, yellow-haired girl standing up midway
down the hall. It was Ilse Westgard, unable to
endure such nonsense, and quite regardless of Brisson&rsquo;s
detaining hand and Shotwell&rsquo;s startled remonstrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What that man says is absurd!&rdquo; she cried, her
fresh young voice still gay with laughter. &ldquo;He looks
like a Prussian, and if he is he ought to know where
the law of force has landed his nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the ominous silence around her, Ilse turned and
gaily surveyed the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law of force is the law of robbers,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;That is why this war has been fought&ndash;&ndash;to educate
robbers. And if there remain any robbers they&rsquo;ll have
to be educated. Don&rsquo;t let anybody tell you that the
law of force is the law of life!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; interrupted Bromberg hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ex-soldier of the Death Battalion, comrade,&rdquo;
said Ilse cheerfully. &ldquo;I used a rifle in behalf of the
law of education. Sometimes bayonets educate, sometimes
machine guns. But the sensible way is to have
a meeting, and everybody drink tea and smoke cigarettes
and discuss their troubles without reserve, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
then take a vote as to what is best for everybody concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she seated herself with a smile just as the inevitable
uproar began.</p>
<p>All around her now men and women were shouting
at her; inflamed faces ringed her; gesticulating fists
waved in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you&ndash;&ndash;a spy for Kerensky?&rdquo; yelled a man
in Russian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bourgeoisie has its agents here!&rdquo; bawled a red-haired
Jew. &ldquo;I offer a solemn protest&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agent provocateur!&rdquo; cried many voices. &ldquo;Pay no
attention to her! Go on with the debate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An I. W. W.&ndash;&ndash;a thin, mean-faced American&ndash;&ndash;half
arose and pointed an unwashed finger at Ilse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Government spy,&rdquo; he said distinctly. &ldquo;Keep your
eye on her, comrades. There seems to be a bunch of
them there&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and shut up!&rdquo; said Shotwell, sharply.
&ldquo;Do you want to start a riot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;ll start something!&rdquo; retorted the man,
showing his teeth like a rat. &ldquo;What the hell did you
come here for&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; bawled Bromberg, hoarsely, from the platform.
&ldquo;That woman is recognised and known. Pay no
attention to her, but listen to me. I tell you that
your law is the law of hatred!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla attempted to rise. Jim tried to restrain her:
she pushed his arm aside, but he managed to retain
his grasp on her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man lies!&rdquo; she said excitedly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear
him preaching hatred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not your business&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i>! That man is lying to these ignorant people!
He&rsquo;s telling them a vile untruth! Let me go, Jim&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better keep cool,&rdquo; whispered Brisson, leaning over.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in dutch already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla said to him excitedly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to stand up
and speak, but I&rsquo;m going to! I&rsquo;d be a coward to sit
here and let that man deceive these poor people&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to Bromberg!&rdquo; motioned Ilse, her blue eyes
frosty and her cheeks deeply flushed.</p>
<p>The orator had come down into the aisle. Every
venomous word he was uttering now he directed straight
at the quartette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Russia is showing us the way,&rdquo; he said in his growling
voice. &ldquo;Russia makes no distinctions but takes
them all by the throat and wrings their necks&ndash;&ndash;aristocrats,
bourgeoisie, cadets, officers, land owners, intellectuals&ndash;&ndash;all
the vermin, all the parasites! And that
is the law, I tell you! The unfit perish! The strong
inherit the earth!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla sprang to her feet: &ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; she said hotly.
&ldquo;Did not Christ Himself tell us that the meek shall
inherit the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ?&rdquo; thundered Bromberg. &ldquo;Have you come
here to insult us with legends and fairy-tales about a
god?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who mentioned God?&rdquo; retorted Palla in a clear
voice. &ldquo;Unless we ourselves are gods there is none!
But Christ did live! And He was as much a god as
we are. And no more. But He was wiser! And what
He told us is the truth! And I shall not sit silent
while any man or woman teaches robbery and murder.
That&rsquo;s what you mean when you say that the law of
the stronger is the only law! If it is, then the poor
and ignorant are where they belong&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be when they learn the law of life!&rdquo;
roared Bromberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one law of life!&rdquo; cried Palla, turning
to look around her at the agitated audience. &ldquo;The
only law in the world worth obedience is the Law of
Love and of Service! No other laws amount to anything.
Under that law every problem you agitate here
is already solved. There is no injustice that cannot
be righted under it! There is no aspiration that cannot
be realised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned on Bromberg, her hazel eyes very bright,
her face surging with colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came here to pervert the exhortation of Karl
Marx, and unite under the banner of envy and greed
every unhappy heart!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Others also can unite to combat you.
A league of evil is not the only league that can be
formed under this roof. Nor are the soldiers and police
the only or the better weapons to use against you.
What you agitators and mischief makers are really
afraid of is that somebody may really educate your
audiences. And that&rsquo;s exactly what such people as I
intend to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A score or more of people had crowded around her
while she was speaking. Shotwell and Brisson, too,
had risen and stepped to her side. And the entire audience
was on its feet, craning hundreds of necks and
striving to hear and see.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the crowd a shrill American voice
cried: &ldquo;Throw them guys out! They got Wall Street
cash in their pockets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sondheim levelled a finger at Brisson:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for that man!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He published
those lies about Lenine and Trotsky, and he&rsquo;s here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
from Washington to lie about us in the newspapers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The I. W. W. lurched out of his seat and shoved
against Shotwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the hell out o&rsquo; here,&rdquo; he snarled; &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;go on!
Beat it! And take your lady-friends, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brisson said: &ldquo;No use talking to them. You&rsquo;d better
take the ladies out while the going is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as they moved there was an angry murmur:
the I. W. W. gave Palla a violent shove that sent her
reeling, and Shotwell knocked him unconscious across
a bench.</p>
<p>Instantly the hall was in an uproar: there was a
savage rush for Brisson, but he stopped it with levelled
automatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the ladies out!&rdquo; he said coolly to Shotwell,
forcing a path forward at his pistol&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>Plain clothes men were active, too, pushing the excited
Bolsheviki this way and that and clearing a lane
for Palla and Ilse.</p>
<p>Then, as they reached the rear of the hall, there
came a wild howl from the audience, and Shotwell, looking
back, saw Sondheim unfurl a big red flag.</p>
<p>Instantly the police started for the rostrum. The
din became deafening as he threw one arm around
Palla and forced her out into the street, where Ilse and
Brisson immediately joined them.</p>
<p>Then, as they looked around for a taxi, a little
shrimp of a man came out on the steps of the hall and
spat on the sidewalk and cursed them in Russian.</p>
<p>And, as Palla, recognising him, turned around, he
shook his fists at her and at Ilse, promising that they
should be attended to when the proper moment arrived.</p>
<p>Then he spat again, laughed a rather ghastly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
distorted laugh, and backed into the doorway behind
him.</p>
<p>They walked east&ndash;&ndash;there being no taxi in sight.
Ilse and Brisson led; Palla followed beside Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the latter, his voice not yet under complete
control, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d better keep away
from such places in the future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still very much excited: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s abominable,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;that this country should permit such
lies to be spread among the people and do nothing to
counteract this campaign of falsehood! What is going
to happen, Jim, unless educated people combine to
educate the ignorant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; he asked contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By example, first of all. By the purity and general
decency of their own lives. I tell you, Jim, that the
unscrupulous greed of the educated is as dangerous
and vile as the murderous envy of the Bolsheviki.
We&rsquo;ve got to reform ourselves before we can educate
others. And unless we begin by conforming to the Law
of Love and Service, some day the Law of Hate and
Violence will cut our throats for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never dreamed that you&rsquo;d do
such a thing as you did to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid,&rdquo; she said with a nervous tightening
of her arm under his, &ldquo;but I was still more afraid of
being a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to answer that crazy anarchist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody had to. He lied to those poor creatures.
I&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&rsquo;t stand it!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her voice broke a little.
&ldquo;And if there is truly a god in me, as I believe, then
I should show Christ&rsquo;s courage ... lacking His
wisdom,&rdquo; she added so low that he scarcely heard her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>Ilse, walking ahead with Brisson, looked back over
her shoulder at Palla laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that there are some creatures you
can&rsquo;t educate? What do you think of your object
lesson, darling?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p>On a foggy afternoon, toward midwinter, John
Estridge strolled into the new Overseas Club,
which, still being in process of incubation, occupied
temporary quarters on Madison Avenue.</p>
<p>Officers fresh from abroad and still in uniform predominated;
tunics were gay with service and wound
chevrons, citation cords, stars, crosses, strips of striped
ribbon.</p>
<p>There was every sort of head-gear to be seen there,
too, from the jaunty overseas <i>bonnet de police</i>, piped
in various colours, to the corded campaign hat and
leather-visored barrack-cap.</p>
<p>Few cavalry officers were in evidence, but there were
plenty of spurs glittering everywhere&ndash;&ndash;to keep their
owners&rsquo; heels from slipping off the desks, as the pleasantry
of the moment had it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Estridge went directly to a telephone booth, and
presently got his connection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s John Estridge, as usual,&rdquo; he said in a bantering
tone. &ldquo;How are you, Ilse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John! I&rsquo;m so glad you called me! Thank you
so much for the roses! They&rsquo;re exquisite!&ndash;&ndash;matchless!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think they&rsquo;re matchless, just hold one up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
beside your cheek and take a slant at your mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were not going to say such things
to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo; She laughed happily. &ldquo;Where
are you, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Overseas Club. I stopped on my way from
the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&ndash;&ndash;es.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A considerable pause, and then Ilse laughed again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;a
confused, happy laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think you&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;come over?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do <i>you</i> think about it, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said in a humourous voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
afraid of that tendency which you say I&rsquo;m beginning
to exhibit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tendency to drift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;&ndash;&ndash;toward those perilous rocks you warned me
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>are</i> perilous!&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know,&rdquo; he rejoined; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re sitting
on top of &rsquo;em like a bally Lorelei!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s your opinion, hadn&rsquo;t you better steer for
the open sea, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;d better. But you look so sweet up
there, with your classical golden hair, that I think
I&rsquo;ll risk the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t! There&rsquo;s a deadly whirlpool under
them. I&rsquo;m looking down at it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see at the bottom, Ilse? Human
bones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the bottom. It&rsquo;s all surface, like a
shining mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come over and take a look at it with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll only see our own faces reflected....
I think you&rsquo;d better not come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there in about half an hour,&rdquo; he said gaily.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He sauntered out and on into the body of the club,
exchanging with friends a few words here, a smiling
handclasp there; and presently he seated himself near
a window.</p>
<p>For a while he rested his chin on his clenched hand,
staring into space, until a waiter arrived with his
order.</p>
<p>He signed the check, drained his glass, and leaned
forward again with both elbows on his knees, twirling
his silver-headed stick between nervous hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said under his breath, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late,
now.... I&rsquo;m going to see this thing through.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>As he rose to go he caught sight of Jim Shotwell,
seated alone by another window and attempting to read
an evening paper by the foggy light from outside. He
walked over to him, fastening his overcoat on the way.
Jim laid aside his paper and gave him a dull glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are things with you?&rdquo; inquired Estridge, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Are you walking up town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s sombre eyes rested on the discarded paper,
but he did not pick it up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rotten weather,&rdquo; he
said listlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Palla lately?&rdquo; inquired Estridge,
looking down at him with a certain curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very busy girl, I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge seated himself on the arm of a leather chair
and began to pull on his gloves. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand Palla is doing Red Cross and canteen
work, besides organising her celebrated club;&ndash;&ndash;what
is it she calls it?&ndash;&ndash;Combat Club No. 1?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t seen her lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell glanced at the fog and shrugged his shoulders:
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s rather busy&ndash;&ndash;as you say. No, I haven&rsquo;t
seen her. Besides, I&rsquo;m rather out of my element among
the people one runs into at her house. So I simply
don&rsquo;t go any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla&rsquo;s parties are always amusing,&rdquo; ventured
Estridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;but her guests keep you
guessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge smiled: &ldquo;Because they don&rsquo;t conform to
the established scheme of things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. The scheme of things, as it is, suits me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s interesting to hear other people&rsquo;s views.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fed up on queer views&ndash;&ndash;and on queer people,&rdquo;
said Jim, with sudden and irritable emphasis. &ldquo;Why,
hang it all, Jack, when a fellow goes out among apparently
well bred, decent people he takes it for granted
that ordinary, matter of course social conventions prevail.
But nobody can guess what notions are seething
in the bean of any girl you talk to at Palla&rsquo;s house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge laughed: &ldquo;What do you care, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t care if they all didn&rsquo;t seem so
exactly like one&rsquo;s own sort. Why, to look at them,
talk to them, you&rsquo;d never suppose them queer! The
young girl you take in to dinner usually looks as
though butter wouldn&rsquo;t melt in her mouth. And the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
chances are that she&rsquo;s all for socialism, self-determination,
trial marriages and free love!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s bells! I&rsquo;m no prude. I like to overstep conventions,
too. But this wholesale wrecking of the
social structure would be ruinous for a girl like Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Palla doesn&rsquo;t believe in free love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hears it talked about by cracked illuminati.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rain on a duck&rsquo;s back, Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rain drowns young ducks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean all this spouting will end in a deluge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. And then look for dead ducks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not very respectful toward modernism,&rdquo; remarked
Estridge, smiling.</p>
<p>Then Jim broke loose:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modernism? You yourself said that all these crazy
social notions&ndash;&ndash;crazy notions in art, literature, music&ndash;&ndash;arise
from some sort of physical degeneration, or from
the perversion or checking of normal physical functions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually they do&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Shotwell, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mostly due to perversion,
in my opinion. Women have had too much
of a hell of a run for their money during this war.
They&rsquo;ve broken down all the fences and they&rsquo;re loose
and running all over the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;d only kept their fool heads! But no.
Every germ in the wind lodged in their silly brains!
Biff. They want sex equality and a pair of riding
breeches! Bang! They kick over the cradle and
wreck the pantry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wifehood? Played out! Motherhood? In the discards!
Domestic partnership?&ndash;&ndash;each sex to its own
sphere? Ha-ha! That was all very well yesterday.
But woman as a human incubator and brooder is an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
obsolete machine. Why the devil should free and
untramelled womanhood hatch out young?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they choose to, casually, all right. But it&rsquo;s
purely a matter for self-determination. If a girl cares
to take off her Sam Brown belt and her puttees long
enough to nurse a baby, it&rsquo;s a matter that concerns
her, not humanity at large. Because the social revolution
has settled all such details as personal independence
and the same standard for both sexes. So,
<i>a bas</i> Madame Grundy! <i>A la lanterne</i> with the old
r&eacute;gime! No&ndash;&ndash;hang it all, I&rsquo;m through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like Palla any more?&rdquo; inquired Estridge,
still laughing.</p>
<p>Jim gave him a singular look: &ldquo;Yes.... Do
you like Ilse Westgard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge said coolly: &ldquo;I am accepting her as she is.
I like her that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Is that very much?&rdquo; sneered the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to marry her if she&rsquo;d have me,&rdquo; replied
Estridge pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she won&rsquo;t do that, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim eyed him sullenly: &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t accept Palla
as she is&ndash;&ndash;or thinks she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s sincere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that. But no girl can get away with
such notions. Where is it all going to land her?
What will she be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge quoted: &ldquo;&lsquo;It hath not yet appeared what
we shall be.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell rose impatiently, and picked up his overcoat:
&ldquo;All I know is that when two healthy people care
for each other it&rsquo;s their business&ndash;&ndash;their <i>business</i>, I repeat&ndash;&ndash;to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
get together legally and do the decent thing
by the human race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly! Breed legally the finest, healthiest, best
of specimens;&ndash;&ndash;and as many as they can feed and
clothe! For if they don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;if we don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I mean our
own sort&ndash;&ndash;the land will be crawling with the robust
get of all these millions of foreigners, who already
have nearly submerged us in America; and whose spawn
will, one day, smother us to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it all, aren&rsquo;t they breeding like vermin now?
All yellow dogs do&ndash;&ndash;all the unfit produce big litters.
That&rsquo;s the only thing they ever do&ndash;&ndash;accumulate
progeny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are we doing?&ndash;&ndash;our sort, I mean? I&rsquo;ll
tell you! Our sisters are having such a good time that
they won&rsquo;t marry, if they can avoid it, until they&rsquo;re
too mature to get the best results in children. Our
wives, if they condescend to have any offspring at all,
limit the output to one. Because more than one <i>might</i>
damage their beauty. Hell! If the educated classes
are going to practise race suicide and the Bolsheviki
are going to breed like lice, you can figure out the
answer for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked to the foggy street together. Shotwell
said bitterly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do care for Palla. I like Ilse. All the women
one encounters at Palla&rsquo;s parties are gay, accomplished,
clever, piquant. The men also are more or less amusing.
The conversation is never dull. Everybody seems
to be well bred, sincere, friendly and agreeable. But
there&rsquo;s something lacking. One feels it even before one
is enlightened concerning the ultra-modernism of these
admittedly interesting people. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
it is. Actually, deep in their souls, they don&rsquo;t believe
in themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take Palla. She says there is no God&ndash;&ndash;no divinity
except in herself. And I tell you she may think she
believes it, but she doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And her school-girl creed&ndash;&ndash;Love and Service! Fine.
Only there&rsquo;s a prior law&ndash;&ndash;self-preservation; and another&ndash;&ndash;race
preservation! By God, how are you going
to love and serve if girls stop having babies?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for this silly condemnation of the marriage
ceremony, merely because some sanctified Uncle Foozle
once inserted the word &lsquo;obey&rsquo; in it&ndash;&ndash;just because, under
the marriage laws, tyranny and cruelty have been practised&ndash;&ndash;what
callow rot!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laws can be changed; divorce made simple and
non-scandalous as it should be; all rights safeguarded
for the woman; and still have something legal and
recognised by one of those necessary conventions which
make civilisation possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this irresponsible idea of procedure through
mere inclination&ndash;&ndash;this sauntering through life under
no law to safeguard and govern, except the law of
personal preference&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s anarchy! That code spells
demoralisation, degeneracy and disaster!... And
the whole damned thing to begin again&ndash;&ndash;a slow development
of the human race, once more, out of the chaos
of utter barbarism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge, standing there on the sidewalk in the fog,
smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very eloquent, Jim. Why don&rsquo;t you say
all this to Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. I told her, too, that the root of the whole
thing was selfishness. And it is. It&rsquo;s a refusal to play
the game according to rule. There are only two sexes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
and one of &rsquo;em is fashioned to bear young, and the other
is fashioned to hustle for mother and kid. You can&rsquo;t
alter that, whether it&rsquo;s fair or not. It&rsquo;s the game as
we found it. The rules were already provided for
playing it. The legal father and mother are supposed
to look out for their own legal progeny. And any
alteration of this rule, with a view to irresponsible
mating and turning the offspring over to the community
to take care of, would create an unhuman race,
unconscious of the highest form of love&ndash;&ndash;the love for
parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine lot we&rsquo;d be as an incubated race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge laughed: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;And,
if you care for Palla as you say you do, you oughtn&rsquo;t
to leave her entirely alone with her circle of modernist
friends. Stick around! It may make you mad, but if
she likes you, at least she won&rsquo;t commit an indiscretion
with anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could find my own sort as amusing,&rdquo; said
Jim, na&iuml;vely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been going about recently&ndash;&ndash;dances,
dinners, theatres&ndash;&ndash;but I can&rsquo;t seem to keep my mind
off Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge said: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d give your sense of humour
half a chance you&rsquo;d be all right. You take yourself
too solemnly. You let Palla scare you. That&rsquo;s not
the way. The thing to do is to have a jolly time with
her, with them all. Accept her as she thinks she is.
There&rsquo;s no damage done yet. Time enough to throw
fits if she takes the bit and bolts&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He extended his hand, cordially but impatiently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember I once said that girl ought to be
married and have children? If you do the marrying
part she&rsquo;s likely to do the rest very handsomely. And
it will be the making of her.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>Jim held on to his hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what to do, Jack. She isn&rsquo;t in love with me.
And she wouldn&rsquo;t submit to a legal ceremony if she
were. You invoke my sense of humour. I&rsquo;m willing
to give it an airing, only I can&rsquo;t see anything funny
in this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> funny! Palla&rsquo;s funny, but doesn&rsquo;t know it.
You&rsquo;re funny! They&rsquo;re all funny&ndash;&ndash;unintentionally.
But their motives are tragically immaculate. So stick
around and have a good time with Palla until there&rsquo;s
really something to scare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the devil do I know? It&rsquo;s up to you, of
course, what you do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed and strode away through the fog.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It had seemed to Jim a long time since he had seen
Palla. It wasn&rsquo;t very long. And in all that interminable
time he had not once called her up on the telephone&ndash;&ndash;had
not even written her a single line. Nor had she
written to him.</p>
<p>He had gone about his social business in his own
circle, much to his mother&rsquo;s content. He had seen
quite a good deal of Elorn Sharrow; was comfortably
back on the old, agreeable footing; tried desperately
to enjoy it; pretended that he did.</p>
<p>But the days were long in the office; the evenings
longer, wherever he happened to be; and the nights,
alas! were becoming interminable, now, because he slept
badly, and the grey winter daylight found him unrefreshed.</p>
<p>Which, recently, had given him a slightly battered
appearance, commented on jestingly by young rakes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
and old sports at the Patroon&rsquo;s Club, and also observed
by his mother with gentle concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overdo it, Jim,&rdquo; she cautioned him, meaning
dances that ended with breakfasts and that sort of
thing. But her real concern was vaguer than that&ndash;&ndash;deeper,
perhaps. And sometimes she remembered the
girl in black.</p>
<p>Lately, however, that anxiety had been almost entirely
allayed. And her comparative peace of mind
had come about in an unexpected manner.</p>
<p>For, one morning, entering the local Red Cross
quarters, where for several hours she was accustomed
to sew, she encountered Mrs. Speedwell and her lively
daughter, Connie&ndash;&ndash;her gossiping informants concerning
her son&rsquo;s appearance at Delmonico&rsquo;s with the mysterious
girl in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you suppose, Helen?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Speedwell, mischievously. &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s pretty mystery in
black is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Shotwell, flushing and looking
around her at the rows of prophylactic ladies, all sewing
madly side by side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she&rsquo;s prettier even than I thought her
in Delmonico&rsquo;s,&rdquo; remarked Connie. &ldquo;Her name is Palla
Dumont, and she&rsquo;s a friend of Leila Vance.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>During the morning, Mrs. Shotwell found it convenient
to speak to Leila Vance; and they exchanged
a pleasant word or two&ndash;&ndash;merely the amiable civilities
of two women who recognise each other socially as
well as personally.</p>
<p>And it happened in that way, a few days later, that
Helen Shotwell met this pretty friend of Leila Vance&ndash;&ndash;Palla
Dumont&ndash;&ndash;the girl in black.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>And Palla had looked up from her work with her
engaging smile, saying: &ldquo;I know your son, Mrs. Shotwell.
Is he quite well? I haven&rsquo;t seen him for such a
long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And instantly the invisible antenn&aelig; of these two
women became busy exploring, probing, searching,
and recognising in each other all that remains forever
incomprehensible to man.</p>
<p>For Palla somehow understood that Jim had never
spoken of her to his mother; and yet that his mother
had heard of her friendship with her son.</p>
<p>And Helen knew that Palla was quietly aware of
this, and that the girl&rsquo;s equanimity remained undisturbed.</p>
<p>Only people quite sure of themselves preserved serenity
under the merciless exploration of the invisible feminine
antenn&aelig;. And it was evident that the girl in
black had nothing to conceal from her in regard to
her only son&ndash;&ndash;whatever that same son might think he
ought to make an effort to conceal from his mother.</p>
<p>To herself Helen thought: &ldquo;Jim has had his wings
singed, and has fled the candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Palla she said: &ldquo;Mrs. Vance tells me such interesting
stories of your experiences in Russia. Really,
it&rsquo;s like a charming romance&ndash;&ndash;your friendship for the
poor little Grand Duchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tragic one,&rdquo; said Palla in a voice so even that
Helen presently lifted her eyes from her sewing to read
in her expression something more than the mere words
that this young girl had uttered. And saw a still, pale
face, sensitive and very lovely; and the needle flying
over a bandage no whiter than the hand that held it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great shock to you&ndash;&ndash;her death,&rdquo; said
Helen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;you were there at the time! How dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla lifted her brown eyes: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about it
yet,&rdquo; she said so simply that Helen&rsquo;s sixth sense, always
alert for information from the busy, invisible antenn&aelig;,
suddenly became convinced that there were no more
hidden depths to explore&ndash;&ndash;no motives to suspect, no
pretense to expose.</p>
<p>Day after day she chose to seat herself between
Palla and Leila Vance; and the girl began to fascinate
her.</p>
<p>There was no effort to please on Palla&rsquo;s part, other
than that natural one born of sweet-tempered consideration
for everybody. There seemed to be no pretence,
no pose.</p>
<p>Such untroubled frankness, such unconscious candour
were rather difficult to believe in, yet Helen was
now convinced that in Palla these phenomena were quite
genuine. And she began to understand more clearly, as
the week wore on, why her son might have had a hard
time of it with Palla Dumont before he returned to
more familiar pastures, where camouflage and not candour
was the rule in the gay and endless game of blind-man&rsquo;s
buff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl,&rdquo; thought Helen Shotwell to herself,
&ldquo;could easily have taken Jim away from Elorn Sharrow
had she chosen to do so. There is no doubt about her
charm and her goodness. She certainly is a most unusual
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she did not say this to her only son. She did
not even tell him that she had met his girl in black.
And Palla had not informed him; she knew that; because
the girl herself had told her that she had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
seen Jim for &ldquo;a long, long time.&rdquo; It really was not
nearly as long as Palla seemed to consider it.</p>
<p>Helen lunched with Leila Vance one day. The former
spoke pleasantly of Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s such a darling,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vance, &ldquo;but the
child worries me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s absorbed some ultra-modern Russian
notions&ndash;&ndash;socialistic ones&ndash;&ndash;rather shockingly radical.
Can you imagine it in a girl who began her novitiate
as a Carmelite nun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen said: &ldquo;She does not seem to have a tendency
toward extremes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has. That awful affair in Russia seemed to
shock her from one extreme to another. It&rsquo;s a long
way from the cloister to the radical rostrum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She spoke of this new Combat Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She organised it,&rdquo; said Leila. &ldquo;They have a hall
where they invite public discussion of social questions
three nights a week. The other three nights, a rival
and very red club rents the hall and howls for anarchy
and blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange?&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;One can not imagine
such a girl devoting herself to radical propaganda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too radical,&rdquo; said Leila. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m keeping an uneasy
eye on that very wilful and wrong-headed child. Why,
my dear, she has the most fastidious, the sweetest, the
most chaste mind, and yet the things she calmly discusses
would make your hair curl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example?&rdquo; inquired Helen, astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for example, they&rsquo;ve all concluded that it&rsquo;s
time to strip poor old civilisation of her tinsel customs,
thread-worn conventions, polite legends, and pleasant
falsehoods.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;All laws are silly. Everybody is to do as they
please, conforming only to the universal law of Love
and Service. Do you see where that would lead some
of those pretty hot-heads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, I should think so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But they can&rsquo;t seem to understand that
the unscrupulous are certain to exploit them&ndash;&ndash;that the
most honest motives&ndash;&ndash;the purest&ndash;&ndash;invite that certain
disaster consequent on social irregularities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla, so far, is all hot-headed enthusiast&ndash;&ndash;hot-hearted
theorist. But I remember that she did take
the white veil once. And, as I tell you, I shall try to
keep her within range of my uneasy vision. Because,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s really a perfect darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a most attractive girl,&rdquo; said Helen slowly;
&ldquo;but I think she&rsquo;d be more attractive still if she were
happily married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And had children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their eyes met, unsmilingly, yet in silent accord.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Their respective cars awaited them at the Ritz and
took them in different directions. But all the afternoon
Helen Shotwell&rsquo;s mind was occupied with what she now
knew of Palla Dumont. And she realised that she
wished the girl were back in Russia in spite of all her
charm and fascination&ndash;&ndash;yes, on account of it.</p>
<p>Because this lovely, burning asteroid might easily
cross the narrow orbit through which her own social
world spun peacefully in its orderly progress amid
that metropolitan galaxy called Society.</p>
<p>Leila Vance was part of that galaxy. So was her
own and only son. Wandering meteors that burnt so
prettily might yet do damage.</p>
<p>For Helen, having known this girl, found it not any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
too easy to believe that her son could have relinquished
her completely in so disturbingly brief a time.</p>
<p>Had she been a young man she knew that she would
not have done so. And, knowing it, she was troubled.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Meanwhile, her only son was troubled, too, as he
walked slowly homeward through the winter fog.</p>
<p>And by the time he was climbing his front steps
he had concluded to accept this girl as she was&ndash;&ndash;or
thought she was&ndash;&ndash;to pull no more long faces or sour
faces, but to go back to her, resolutely determined
to enjoy her friendship and her friends too; and give
his long incarcerated sense of humour an airing, even
if he suffered acutely while it revelled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s activities seemed to exhilarate her physically
and mentally. Body and brain were now
fully occupied; and, if the profit to her soul were
dubious, nevertheless the restless spirit of the girl now
had an outlet; and at home and in the Combat Club she
planned and discussed and investigated the world&rsquo;s woes
to her ardent heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>Physically, too, Red Cross and canteen work gave
her much needed occupation; and she went everywhere
on foot, never using bus, tram or taxicab. The result
was, in spite of late and sometimes festive hours, that
Palla had become something more than an unusually
pretty girl, for there was much of real beauty in her
full and charming face and in her enchantingly rounded
yet lithe and lissome figure.</p>
<p>About the girl, also, there seemed to be a new freshness
like fragrance&ndash;&ndash;a virginal sweetness&ndash;&ndash;that indefinable
perfume of something young and vigorous that
is already in bud.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>That morning she went over to the dingy row of
buildings to sign the lease of the hall for three evenings
a week, as quarters for Combat Club No. 1.</p>
<p>The stuffy place where the Red Flag Club had met
the night before was still reeking with stale smoke and
the effluvia of the unwashed; but the windows were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
open and a negro was sweeping up a litter of defunct
cigars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yaas&rsquo;m, Mr. Puma&rsquo;s office is next do&rsquo;,&rdquo; he replied
to Palla&rsquo;s inquiry; &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;Sooperfillum Co&rsquo;poration.
Yaas&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next door had been a stable and auction ring, and
odours characteristic still remained, although now the
ring had been partitioned, boarded over and floored, and
Mr. Hewitt&rsquo;s glass rods full of blinding light were
suspended above the studio ceilings of the Super-Picture
Corporation.</p>
<p>Palla entered the brick archway. An office on the
right bore the name of Angelo Puma; and that large,
richly coloured gentleman hastily got out of his desk
chair and flashed a pair of magnificent as well as astonished
eyes upon Palla as she opened the door and
walked in.</p>
<p>When she had seated herself and stated her business,
Puma, with a single gesture, swept from the office
several men and a stenographer, and turned to Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, then, who are this Combat Club which
would rent from me the hall next door!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
showing every faultless tooth in his head.</p>
<p>Palla smiled: &ldquo;I am empowered by the club to sign
a lease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is sufficient!&rdquo; exclaimed Puma, with a superb
gesture. &ldquo;So! It is signed! Your desire is enough.
The matter is accomplished when you express the wish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla blushed a little but smilingly affixed her signature
to the papers elaborately presented by Angelo
Puma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lease?&rdquo; he remarked, with a flourish of his large,
sanguine, and jewelled hand. &ldquo;A detail merely for your
security, Miss Dumont. For me, I require only the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
expression of your slightest wish. That, to me, is a
command more binding than the seal of the notary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he flashed his dazzling smile on Palla, who was
tucking her copy of the agreement into her muff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much, Mr. Puma,&rdquo; she said, almost
inclined to laugh at his extravagances. And she laid
down a certified check to cover the first month&rsquo;s rental.</p>
<p>Mr. Puma bowed; his large, heavily lashed black
eyes were very brilliant; his mouth much too red under
the silky black moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me,&rdquo; he said impulsively, &ldquo;art alone matters.
What is money? What is rent? What are all the annoying
details of commerce? Interruptions to the soul-flow!
Checks to the fountain jet of inspiration! Art
only is important. Have you ever seen a cinema
studio, Miss Dumont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla never had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it interest you, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&ndash;&ndash;some time&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but a step! They are working. A peep will
take but a moment&ndash;&ndash;if you please&ndash;&ndash;a thousand excuses
that I proceed to show you the way!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped through a door. From a narrow anteroom
she saw the set-scene in a ghastly light, where
men in soiled shirt-sleeves dragged batteries of electric
lights about, each underbred face as livid as the visage
of a corpse too long unburied.</p>
<p>There were women there, too, looking a little more
human in their makeups under the horrible bluish glare.
Camera men were busy; a cadaverous and profane director,
with his shabby coat-collar turned up, was talking
loudly in a Broadway voice and jargon to a bewildered
girl wearing a ball gown.</p>
<p>As Puma led Palla through the corridor from partition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
to partition, disclosing each set with its own scene
and people&ndash;&ndash;the whole studio full of blatant noise and
ghastly faces or painted ones, Palla thought she had
never before beheld such a concentration of every type
of commonness in her entire existence. Faces, shapes,
voices, language, all were essentially the properties of
congenital vulgarity. The language, too, had to be
sharply rebuked by Puma once or twice amid the
wrangling of director, camera man and petty subordinates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So intense are the emotions evoked by a fanatic
devotion to art,&rdquo; he explained to Palla, &ldquo;that, at
moments, the old, direct and vigorous Anglo-Saxon
tongue is heard here, unashamed. What will you? It
is art! It is the fervour that forgets itself in blind
devotion&ndash;&ndash;in rapturous self-dedication to the god of
Truth and Beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she turned away, she heard from a neighbouring
partition the hoarse expostulations of one of Art&rsquo;s
blind acolytes: &ldquo;Say, f&rsquo;r Christ&rsquo;s sake, Delmour, what
the hell&rsquo;s loose in your bean! Yeh done it wrong an&rsquo;
yeh know damn well yeh done it wrong&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma opened another door: &ldquo;One of our projection
rooms, Miss Dumont. If it is your pleasure to see a
few reels run off&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I really must go&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The office door stood open and she went out that way.
Mr. Puma confronted her, moistly brilliant of eye:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, Miss Dumont, I am frank like there never
was a child in arms! Yes. I am all art; all heart.
For me, beauty is God!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he kissed his fat fingers
and wafted the caress toward the dirty ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please excuse,&rdquo; he said with his powerful smile,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
&ldquo;but have you ever, perhaps, thought, Miss Dumont,
of the screen as a career?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; asked Palla, surprised and amused. &ldquo;No, Mr.
Puma, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A test! Possibly, in you, latent, sleeps the exquisite
apotheosis of Art incarnate! Who can tell?
You have youth, beauty, a mind! Yes. Who knows
if, also, happily, genius slumbers within? Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sure it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Palla, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Who can be sure of anything&ndash;&ndash;even of heaven!&rdquo;
cried Puma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said Palla, trying to speak seriously,
&ldquo;But the career of a moving picture actress does not
attract me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The emoluments are enormous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A test! We try! It would be amusing for you to
see yourself upon the screen as you are, Miss Dumont?
As you <i>are</i>&ndash;&ndash;young, beautiful, vivacious&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still blocked her way, so she said, laying her
gloved hand on the knob:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much. Some day, perhaps. But
I really must go&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He immediately bowed, opened the glass door, and
went with her to the brick arch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have
entered partnership with a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Elmer Skidder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she exclaimed, smilingly, &ldquo;I hope the partnership
will be a fortunate one. Will you kindly inform
Mr. Skidder of my congratulations and best wishes for
his prosperity? And you may say that I shall be glad
to hear from him about his new enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>To Mr. Puma&rsquo;s elaborate leave-taking she vouchsafed
a quick, amused nod, then hurried away eastward
to keep her appointment at the Canteen.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>About five o&rsquo;clock she experienced a healthy inclination
for tea and wavered between the Plaza and home.
Ilse and Marya were with her, but an indefinable something
caused her to hesitate, and finally to let them
go to the Plaza without her.</p>
<p>What might be the reason of this sudden whim for an
unpremeditated cup of tea at home she scarcely took
the trouble to analyse. Yet, she was becoming conscious
of a subtle and increasing exhilaration as she
approached her house and mounted the steps.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as she fitted the latch-key, her heart leaped
and she knew why she had come home.</p>
<p>For a moment her fast pulse almost suffocated her.
Was she mad to return here on the wildest chance that
Jim might have come&ndash;&ndash;might be inside, waiting? And
what in the world made her suppose so?&ndash;&ndash;for she had
neither seen him nor heard from him in many days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly a little crazy,&rdquo; she thought as she
opened the door. At the same moment her eyes fell on
his overcoat and hat and stick.</p>
<p>Her skirt was rather tight, but her limbs were supple
and her feet light, and she ran upstairs to the living
room.</p>
<p>As he rose from an armchair she flung her arms out
with a joyous little cry and wrapped them tightly
around his neck, muff, reticule and all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You darling,&rdquo; he was saying over and over in a
happy but rather stupid voice, and crushing her narrow
hands between his; &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;you adorable child, you wonderful
girl&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad, Jim! Shall we have tea?...
You dear fellow! I&rsquo;m so very happy that you came!
Wait a moment&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she leaned wide from him and touched
an electric bell. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll have to behave properly,&rdquo;
she said with delightful malice.</p>
<p>He released her; she spoke to the maid and then
went over with him to the sofa, flinging muff, stole
and purse on a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pure premonition,&rdquo; she explained, stripping the
gloves from her hands. &ldquo;Ilse and Marya were all for
the Plaza, but something sent me homeward! Isn&rsquo;t
it really very strange, Jim? Why, I almost had an
inclination to run when I turned into our street&ndash;&ndash;not
even knowing why, of course&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so sweet and generous!&rdquo; he blurted out.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you raise hell with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said demurely, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t raise hell,
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve behaved so rottenly&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really wasn&rsquo;t friendly to neglect me so entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down&ndash;&ndash;laid one hand on hers in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, Jim,&rdquo; she said sweetly. &ldquo;Is it all
right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.... Of course I haven&rsquo;t
changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... What is there for me to do but
to accept things as they are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, &lsquo;accept <i>me</i> as I am!&rsquo; Oh, Jim, it&rsquo;s so
dear of you. And you know well enough that I care
for no other man as I do for you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waitress with the tea-tray cut short that sort of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
conversation. Palla&rsquo;s appetite was a healthy one. She
unpinned her hat and flung it on the piano. Then she
nestled down sideways on the sofa, one leg tucked under
the other knee, her hair in enough disorder to worry any
other girl&ndash;&ndash;and began to tuck away tea and cakes.
Sometimes, in animated conversation, she gesticulated
with a buttered bun&ndash;&ndash;once she waved her cup to emphasise
her point:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main idea, of course, is to teach the eternal
law of Love and Service,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But, Jim,
I have become recently, and in a measure, militant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to love the unwashed with a club?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You very impudent boy! We&rsquo;re going to combat
this new and terrible menace&ndash;&ndash;this sinister flood that
threatens the world&ndash;&ndash;the crimson tide of anarchy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, darling! I enlist for a machine gun
uni&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! The battle is to be entirely verbal. Our
Combat Club No. 1, the first to be established&ndash;&ndash;is open
to anybody and everybody. All are at liberty to enter
into the discussions. We who believe in the Law of Love
and Service shall have our say every evening that the
club is open&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Reds may come and take a crack at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Reds are welcome. We wish to face them
across the rostrum, not across a barricade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you dear girl, I can&rsquo;t see how any Red is
going to resist you. And if any does, I&rsquo;ll knock his
bally block off&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, you&rsquo;re so vernacularly inclined! And you&rsquo;re
very flippant, too&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really,&rdquo; he said in a lower voice. &ldquo;Whatever
you care about could not fail to appeal to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>She gave him a quick, sweet glance, then searched
the tea-tray to reward him.</p>
<p>As she gave him another triangle of cinnamon toast,
she remembered something else. It was on the tip of
her tongue, now; and she checked herself.</p>
<p><i>He</i> had not spoken of it. Had his mother mentioned
meeting her at the Red Cross? If not&ndash;&ndash;was it merely
a natural forgetfulness on his mother&rsquo;s part? Was
her silence significant?</p>
<p>Nibbling pensively at her cinnamon toast, Palla pondered
this. But the girl&rsquo;s mind worked too directly
for concealment to come easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whether your mother
mentioned our meeting at the Red Cross.&rdquo; And she
knew immediately by his expression that he heard it
for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was introduced at our headquarters by Leila
Vance,&rdquo; said Palla, in her even voice; &ldquo;and your mother
and she are acquaintances. That is how it happened,
Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still somewhat flushed but he forced a smile:
&ldquo;Did you find my mother agreeable, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And she is so beautiful with her young face
and pretty white hair. She always sits between Leila
and me while we sew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say you knew me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he repeated, reddening again.</p>
<p>No man ever has successfully divined any motive
which any woman desires to conceal.</p>
<p>Why his mother had not spoken of Palla to him he
did not know. He was aware, of course, that nobody
within the circle into which he had been born would
tolerate Palla&rsquo;s social convictions. Had she casually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
and candidly revealed a few of them to his mother
in the course of the morning&rsquo;s conversation over their
sewing?</p>
<p>He gave Palla a quick look, encountered her slightly
amused eyes, and turned redder than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear boy,&rdquo; she said, smiling, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
your very charming mother would be interested in
knowing me. The informality of ultra-modern people
could not appeal to her generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you&ndash;&ndash;talk to her about&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But it might happen. You know, Jim, I
have nothing to conceal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old troubled look had come back into his face.
She noticed it and led the conversation to lighter
themes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We danced last night after dinner,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;There were some amusing people here for dinner.
Then we went to see such a charming play&ndash;&ndash;<i>Tea for
Three</i>&ndash;&ndash;and then we had supper at the Biltmore and
danced.... Will you dine with me to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;d enjoy it?&ndash;&ndash;a lot of people who
entertain the same shocking beliefs that I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said with emphasis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through
playing the r&ocirc;le of death&rsquo;s-head at the feast. I told
you that I&rsquo;m going to take you as you are and enjoy
you and our friends&ndash;&ndash;and quit making an ass of
myself&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, you never did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I did. And maybe I&rsquo;m a predestined ass.
But every ass has a pair of heels and I&rsquo;m going to
flourish mine very gaily from now on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She protested laughingly at his self-characterisation,
and bent toward him a little, caressing his sleeve in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
appeal, or shaking it in protest as he denounced himself
and promised to take the world more gaily in the
future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he remarked, rising to take his leave:
&ldquo;I may even call the bluff of some of your fluffy ultra-modern
friends and try a few trial marriages with each
of &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, you&rsquo;re absolutely horrid! As if my friends
believed in such disgusting ideas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do&ndash;&ndash;some of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I do!&rdquo; he announced so gravely that she
had to look at him closely in the rather dim lamplight
to see whether he was jesting.</p>
<p>She walked to the top of the staircase with him;
let him take her into his arms; submitted to his kiss.
Always a little confused by his demonstrations, nevertheless
her hand retained his for a second longer, as
though shyly reluctant to let him go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you came,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t neglect
me any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he went his way.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>His mother discovered him in the library, dressed
for dinner. Something, as he rose&ndash;&ndash;his manner of looking
at her, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;warned her that they were not
perfectly <i>en rapport</i>. Then the subtle, invisible antenn&aelig;,
exploring caressingly what is so palpable in the
heart of man, told her that once more she was to deal
with the girl in black.</p>
<p>When his mother was seated, he said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
you had met Palla Dumont, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen hesitated: &ldquo;Mrs. Vance&rsquo;s friend? Oh, yes;
she comes to the Red Cross with Leila Vance.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her son&rsquo;s eyes she was aware of that subtle and
unconscious appeal which all mothers of boys are, some
day, fated to see and understand.</p>
<p>Sometimes the appeal is disguised, sometimes it is
so subtle that only mothers are able to perceive it.</p>
<p>But what to do about it is the perennial problem.
For between lack of sympathy and response there are
many nuances; and opposition is always to be avoided.</p>
<p>Helen said, pleasantly, that the girl appeared to
be amiable and interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know her merely in that way,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;We
sit there sewing slings, pads, compresses, and bandages,
and we gossip at random with our neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like her very much,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does seem to be an attractive girl,&rdquo; said his
mother carelessly.... &ldquo;Are you going to Yama
Farms for the week end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. The Speedwells&rsquo; party is likely to
be such a jolly affair, and I hear there&rsquo;s lots of snow
up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t met Mrs. Vance,&rdquo; said her son. &ldquo;Is she
nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leila Vance? Why, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She married an embassy attach&eacute;, Captain Vance.
He was in the old army&ndash;&ndash;killed at Mons four years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She and Palla are intimate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they are good friends,&rdquo; remarked his
mother, deciding not to attempt to turn the current
of conversation for the moment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure I never met a girl I like as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen laughed: &ldquo;That is a trifle extravagant, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.... I asked her to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s heart stood still, then a bright flush stained
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She refused me,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>His mother said very quietly: &ldquo;Of course this is
news to us, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I didn&rsquo;t tell you. I couldn&rsquo;t, somehow. But
I&rsquo;ve told you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; she said, dropping her hand over his,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t think me unsympathetic if I say that it really is
better that she refused you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. But I don&rsquo;t think you do. Because I
am still in love with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rotten luck, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time heals&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She checked herself, turned and
kissed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a soldier learns how to take
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And presently: &ldquo;I do wish you&rsquo;d go up to Yama
Farms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would be the obvious thing to do.
Anything to keep going and keep your mind ticking
away until you&rsquo;re safely wound up again.... But
I&rsquo;m not going, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen looked at him in silence, not wondering what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
he might be going to do with his week-end instead,
because she already guessed.</p>
<p>Before she said anything more his father came in;
and a moment later dinner was announced.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Jim slept soundly for the first night in a long time.
His mother scarcely closed her eyes at all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p>There had been a row at the Red Flag Club&ndash;&ndash;a
matter of differing opinions between members&ndash;&ndash;nothing
sufficient to attract the police, but
enough to break several heads, benches and windows.
And it was evident that some gentleman&rsquo;s damaged nose
had bled all over the linoleum in the lobby.</p>
<p>Elmer Skidder, arriving at the studio next morning
in his brand new limousine, heard about the shindy
and went into the club to inspect the wreckage. Then,
mad all through, he started out to find Puma. But a
Sister Art had got the best of Angelo Puma in a
questionable cabaret the night before, and he had not
yet arrived at the studio of the Super-Picture Corporation.</p>
<p>Skidder, thrifty by every instinct, and now smarting
under his wrongs at the hands&ndash;&ndash;and feet&ndash;&ndash;of the Red
Flag Club, went away in his gorgeous limousine to find
Sondheim, who paid the rental and who lived in the
Bronx.</p>
<p>It was a long way; every mile and every gallon of
gasoline made Skidder madder; and when at length
he arrived at the brand new, jerry-built apartment
house inhabited by Max Sondheim, he had concluded
that the Red Flag Club was an undesirable tenant and
that it must be summarily kicked out.</p>
<p>Sondheim was still in bed, but a short-haired and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
pallid young woman, with assorted spots on her complexion,
bade Skidder enter, and opened the chamber
door for him.</p>
<p>The bedroom, which smelled of sour fish, was very
cold, very dirty, and very blue with cigar smoke. The
remains of a delicatessen breakfast stood on a table
near the only window, which was tightly shut, and
under the sill of which a radiator emitted explosive
symptoms of steam to come.</p>
<p>Sondheim sprawled under the bed-covers, smoking;
two other men sat on the edge of the bed&ndash;&ndash;Karl Kastner
and Nathan Bromberg. Both were smoking porcelain
pipes. Three slopping quarts of beer decorated
the wash stand.</p>
<p>Skidder, who had halted in the doorway as the full
aroma of the place smote him, now entered at the curt
suggestion of Sondheim, but refused a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Sondheim,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I been to the club this
morning, and I&rsquo;ve seen what you&rsquo;ve done to the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Sondheim, in a growling voice,
&ldquo;what haf we done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing;&ndash;&ndash;smashed the furniture f&rsquo;r instance.
That&rsquo;s all. But it don&rsquo;t go with me. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kastner got up and gave him a sinister, near-sighted
look: &ldquo;If ve done damach ve pay,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;ll pay!&rdquo; blustered Skidder. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
all right, too. But no more for yours truly. I&rsquo;m
through. Here&rsquo;s where your bunch quits the hall for
keeps. Get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please?&rdquo; inquired Kastner, turning a brick red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I&rsquo;m through!&rdquo; blustered Skidder. &ldquo;You gotta
get other quarters. It don&rsquo;t pay us to keep on buying
benches and mending windows, even if you cough up
for &rsquo;em. It don&rsquo;t pay us to rent the hall to your club
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
and get all this here notoriety, what with your red flags
and the <i>po</i>-lice hanging around and nosin&rsquo; into everything&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach wass!&rdquo; snapped Kastner, &ldquo;of vat are you
speaking? Iss it for you to concern yourself mit our
club und vat iss it ve do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who d&rsquo;yeh think you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; to?&rdquo; retorted
Skidder, his eyes snapping furiously. &ldquo;Grab this from
me, old scout?&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m half owner of that hall and I&rsquo;m
telling you to get out! Is that plain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Kastner sneered at him and nudged Sondheim,
who immediately sat up in bed and levelled an
unwashed hand at Skidder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you fire us?&rdquo; he shouted, his eyes inflamed
and his dirty fingers crisping to a talon. &ldquo;You
go home and tell Puma what you say to us. Then
you learn something maybe, what you don&rsquo;t know
already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll learn <i>you</i> something!&rdquo; retorted Skidder. &ldquo;Just
wait till I show Puma the wreckage&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him look at it and be damned!&rdquo; roared Bromberg.
&ldquo;Go home and show it to him! And see if he
talks about firing us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; demanded Skidder, astonished, &ldquo;do you fellows
think you got any drag with Angy Puma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back and ask him!&rdquo; growled Bromberg. &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t try to come around here and get fresh again.
Listen! You go buy what benches you say we broke
and send the bill to me, and keep your mouth shut and
mind your fool business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mind my own and yours too!&rdquo; screamed Skidder,
seized by an ungovernable access of fury. &ldquo;Say, you
poor nut!&ndash;&ndash;you sick mink!&ndash;&ndash;you stale hunk of cheese!&ndash;&ndash;if
you come down my way again I&rsquo;ll kick your shirttail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
for you! Get that?&rdquo; And he slammed the door and
strode out in a flaming rage.</p>
<p>But when, still furiously excited, he arrived once more
at the office,&ndash;&ndash;and when Puma, who had just entered,
had listened in sullen consternation to his story, he
received another amazing and most unpleasant shock.
For Puma told him flatly that the tenancy of the Red
Flag Club suited him; that no lease could be broken,
except by mutual consent of partners; and that he,
Skidder, had had no business to go to Sondheim with
any such threat of eviction unless he had first consulted
his partner&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&ndash;&ndash;what&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; stammered Skidder&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;what
the hell drag have those guys got with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it you talk foolish?&rdquo; retorted Puma sharply.
&ldquo;Drag? Did Sondheim say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! <i>I</i> say it. I ask you what have those crazy
nuts got on you that you stand for all this rumpus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma&rsquo;s lustrous eyes, battered but still magnificent,
fixed themselves on Skidder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go out,&rdquo; he said briefly to his stenographer. Then,
when the girl had gone, and the glass door closed behind
her, he turned heavily and gazed at Skidder some
more. And, after a few moments&rsquo; silence: &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;What did Sondheim say about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skidder&rsquo;s small, shifty eyes were blinking furiously
and his essentially suspicious mind was also operating
at full speed. When he had calculated what to say he
took the chance, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sondheim gave me to understand that he&rsquo;s got such
a hell of a pull with you that I can&rsquo;t kick him out
of my property. What do you know about that,
Angelo?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Puma impatiently, &ldquo;what else did he
say about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I telling you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skidder had no more to tell, so he manufactured
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued craftily, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly get
what that kike said.&rdquo; But his grin and his manner gave
his words the lie, as he intended they should. &ldquo;Something
about your being in dutch&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He checked himself
as Puma&rsquo;s black eyes lighted with a momentary
glare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? He tells you I am in with Germans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw;&ndash;&ndash;in dutch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma&rsquo;s sanguinary skin reddened; his puffy fingers
fished for a cigar in the pocket of his fancy waistcoat;
he found one and lighted it, not looking at his partner.
Then he picked up the morning paper.</p>
<p>Skidder shrugged; stood up, pretending to yawn;
started to open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh? What y&rsquo;want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know exactly what Max Sondheim said
to you about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you better go ask Sondheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I ask you&ndash;&ndash;my friend&ndash;&ndash;my associate in business&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine associate!&ndash;&ndash;when I can&rsquo;t kick in when I want
to kick out a bunch of nuts that&rsquo;s wrecking the hall,
just because they got a drag with you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen. I am frank like there never was a&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say it! Yes! I am frank like hell. From my
friend and partner I conceal nothing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not even the books,&rdquo; grinned Skidder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elmer. You pain me. I who am all heart! Elmer,
I ask it of you if you will so kindly tell me what it is
that Sondheim has said to you about this &lsquo;drag.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said,&rdquo; replied the other viciously, &ldquo;that he had
you cinched. He said you&rsquo;d hand me the ha-ha when
I saw you. And you&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon. I did not say to you a ha-ha, Elmer. I
was surprised when you have told me how you have gone
to Sondheim so roughly, without one word to me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was soused to the gills last night. I didn&rsquo;t
know when you&rsquo;d show up at the studio&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not just to me that you go to Sondheim in
this so surprising manner, without informing me.&rdquo; He
looked at his cigar; the wrapper was broken and he
licked the place with a fat tongue. &ldquo;Elmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; replied the other, who had been slyly
watching him. &ldquo;Spit it out, Angy. What&rsquo;s on your
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Elmer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma&rsquo;s face became suddenly wreathed in guileless
smiles: &ldquo;Me, I am frank like there never&ndash;&ndash;but no
matter,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;listen attentively to what I shall
say to you secretly, that I also desire to be rid of this
Red Flag Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A moment! I am embarrass. Yes. You ask why?
I shall tell you. It is this. Formerly I have reside in
Mexico. My business has been in Mexico City. I have
there a little cinema theatre. In 1913 I arrive in New
York. You ask me why I came? And I am frank
like&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; his full smile burst on Skidder&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;like a heaven
angel! But it is God&rsquo;s truth I came here to make of
the cinema a monument to Art.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And make your little pile too, eh, Angy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please. But this I affirm to you, Elmer; of
politics I am innocent like there never was a cherubim!
Yes! And yet your Government has question me.
Why? you ask so naturally. My God! I know no one
in New York. I arrive. I repair to a recommended
hotel. I make acquaintance&ndash;&ndash;unhappily&ndash;&ndash;with people
who are under a suspicion of German sympathy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil did you do that for?&rdquo; demanded
Skidder.</p>
<p>Puma spread his jewelled fingers helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I to know? I encounter people. I seek
capital for my art. Me, I am all heart: I suspect
nobody. I say: &lsquo;Gentlemen, my art is my life. Without
it I cease to exist. I desire capital; I desire sympathy;
I desire intelligent recognition and practical
aid.&rsquo; Yes. In time some gentlemen evince confidence.
I am offered funds. I produce, with joy, my first picture.
Ha! The success is extravagant! But&ndash;&ndash;alas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tripped you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; repeated Puma, &ldquo;your Government arrests
some gentlemen who have lend to me much funds. Why?
Imagine my grief, my mortification! They are suspect
of German propaganda! Oh, my God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it they didn&rsquo;t pinch <i>you</i>?&rdquo; asked Skidder
coldly, and beginning to feel very uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? No! They investigate. They discover only
Art!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skidder squinted at him nervously. If he had heard
anything of that sort in connection with Puma he never
would have flirted with him financially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what&rsquo;s this drag they got with you?&ndash;&ndash;Sondheim
and the other nuts?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you. Letters quite innocent but polite they
have in possession&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackmail, by heck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be considerate of Sondheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or he&rsquo;ll squeal on you. Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma&rsquo;s black eyes were flaring up again; the heavy
colour stained his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, I am&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Sondheim&rsquo;s got something on you, then.
Has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing. Yet, it has embarrass me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ratty kike! I get you, Angy. You were
played. Or maybe you did some playing too. Aw!
wait!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;as Puma protested&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting you, by
gobs. Sure. And you&rsquo;re rich, now, and business is
pretty good, and you wish Sondheim would let you
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much hush-cash d&rsquo;yeh pay him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yaas, you! Come on, now, Angy. What does he
stick you up for per month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma&rsquo;s face became empurpled: &ldquo;He is a scoundrel,&rdquo;
he said thickly. &ldquo;Me&ndash;&ndash;I wish to God and Jesus Christ
I saw the last of him!&rdquo; He got up, and his step was
lithe as a leopard&rsquo;s as he paced the room, ranging the
four walls as though caged. And, for the first time,
then Skidder realised that this velvet-eyed, velvet-footed
man might possibly be rather dangerous&ndash;&ndash;dangerous
to antagonise, dangerous to be associated
with in business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he blurted out, &ldquo;what else did you let me
in for when I put my money into your business? Think
I&rsquo;m going to be held up by any game like that? Think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
I&rsquo;m going to stand for any shake-down from that
gang? Watch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma stopped and looked at him stealthily: &ldquo;What
is it you would do, Elmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Skidder offered no suggestion. He remained,
however, extremely uneasy. For it was plain enough
that Puma had been involved in dealings sufficiently
suspicious to warrant Government surveillance.</p>
<p>All Skidder&rsquo;s money and real estate were now invested
in Super-Pictures. No wonder he was anxious.
No wonder Puma, also, seemed worried.</p>
<p>For, whatever he might have done in the past of a
shady nature, now he had become prosperous and financially
respectable and, if let alone, would doubtless continue
to make a great deal of money for Skidder as
well as for himself. And Skidder, profoundly troubled,
wondered whether his partner had ever been guiltily
involved in German propaganda, and had escaped Government
detection only to fall a victim, in his dawning
prosperity, to blackmailing associates of earlier days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mutt Sondheim looks like a bad one to me,
and the other guy&ndash;&ndash;Kastner,&rdquo; he observed gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better that we should not offend them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say it. Yes. We shall be wise to turn to them
a pleasing face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. The best thing to do for a while is to stall
along,&rdquo; nodded Skidder, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;but always be ready for
a chance to hand it to them. That&rsquo;s safest; wait till
we get the goods on them. Then slam it to &rsquo;em
plenty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they annoy me too much,&rdquo; purred Puma, displaying
every dazzling tooth, &ldquo;it may not be so agreeable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
for them. I am bad man to crowd....
Meanwhile&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure; we&rsquo;ll stall along, Angy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They opened the glass door and went out into the
studio. And Puma began again on his favourite theme,
the acquiring of Broadway property and the erection
of a cinema theatre. And Skidder, with his limited
imagination of a cross-roads storekeeper, listened cautiously,
yet always conscious of agreeable thrills whenever
the subject was mentioned.</p>
<p>And, although he knew that capital was shy and
that conditions were not favourable, his thoughts always
reverted to a man he might be willing to go into
such a scheme with&ndash;&ndash;the president of the Shadow Hill
Trust Company, Alonzo Pawling.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At that very moment, too, it chanced that Mr.
Pawling&rsquo;s business had brought him to New York&ndash;&ndash;in
fact, his business was partly with Palla Dumont, and
they were now lunching together at the Ritz.</p>
<p>Alonzo Pawling stood well over six feet. He still
had all his hair&ndash;&ndash;which was dyed black&ndash;&ndash;and also an
inky pair of old-fashioned side whiskers. For the
beauty of his remaining features less could be said,
because his eyes were a melancholy and faded blue, his
nose very large and red, and his small, loose mouth
seemed inclined to sag, as though saturated with moisture.</p>
<p>Many years a widower he had, when convenient opportunity
presented itself, never failed to offer marriage
to Palla Dumont. And when, as always, she
refused him in her frank, amused fashion, they returned
without embarrassment to their amiable footing of
many years&ndash;&ndash;she as child of his old friend and neighbour,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
Judge Dumont, he as her financial adviser, and
banker.</p>
<p>As usual, Mr. Pawling had offered Palla his large,
knotty hand in wedlock that morning. And now that
this inevitable preliminary was safely over, they were
approaching the end of a business luncheon on entirely
amiable terms with each other.</p>
<p>Financial questions had been argued, investments decided
upon, news of the town discussed, and Palla was
now telling him about Elmer Skidder and his new and
apparently prosperous venture into moving pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to see me last evening,&rdquo; she said, smiling
at the recollection, &ldquo;and he arrived in a handsome limousine
with an extra man on the front&ndash;&ndash;oh, very gorgeous,
Mr. Pawling!&ndash;&ndash;and we had tea and he told me
how prosperous he had become in the moving picture
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said Mr. Pawling, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s a lot of
money in moving pictures. But nobody ever seems to
get any of it except the officials of the corporation and
their favourite stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be an exceedingly unattractive business,&rdquo;
said Palla, recollecting her unpleasant impressions
at the Super-Picture studios.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right end of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pawling, &ldquo;is to own
a big theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled: &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t advise me to make such
an investment, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pawling&rsquo;s watery eyes rested on her reflectively
and he sucked in his lower lips as though trying to
extract the omnipresent moisture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; he said absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Skidder told me that he would double his invested
capital in a year,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he was bragging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she rejoined, laughing, &ldquo;but I should
not care to make such an investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he ask you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But it seemed to me that he hinted at something
of that nature. And I was not at all interested
because I am contented with my little investments and
my income as it is. I don&rsquo;t really need much money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pawling&rsquo;s pendulous lip, released, sagged wetly
and his jet-black eyebrows were lifted in a surprised
arch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the first person I ever heard say they had
enough money,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have!&rdquo; she insisted gaily.</p>
<p>Mr. Pawling&rsquo;s sad horse-face regarded her with faded
surprise. He passed for a rich man in Shadow Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Elmer&rsquo;s place of business?&rdquo; he inquired
finally, producing a worn note-book and a gold pencil.
And he wrote down the address.</p>
<p>There was in all the world only one thing that seriously
worried Mr. Pawling, and that was this worn
note-book. Almost every day of his life he concluded to
burn it. He lived in a vague and daily fear that it
might be found on him if he died suddenly. Such
things could happen&ndash;&ndash;automobile or railroad accidents&ndash;&ndash;any
one of numberless mischances.</p>
<p>And still he carried it, and had carried it for years&ndash;&ndash;always
in a sort of terror while the recent Mrs.
Pawling was still alive&ndash;&ndash;and in dull but perpetual
anxiety ever since.</p>
<p>There were in it pages devoted to figures. There
were, also, memoranda of stock transactions. There
were many addresses, too, mostly feminine.</p>
<p>Now he replaced it in the breast pocket of his frock-coat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
and took out a large wallet strapped with a
rubber band.</p>
<p>While he was paying the check, Palla drew on her
gloves; and, at the Madison Avenue door, stood chatting
with him a moment longer before leaving for the
canteen.</p>
<p>Then, smilingly declining his taxi and offering her
slender hand in adieu, she went westward on foot as
usual. And Mr. Pawling&rsquo;s directions to the chauffeur
were whispered ones as though he did not care to have
the world at large share in his knowledge of his own
occult destination.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Palla&rsquo;s duty at the canteen lasted until six o&rsquo;clock
that afternoon, and she hurried on her way home because
people were dining there at seven-thirty.</p>
<p>With the happy recollection that Jim, also, was dining
with her, she ran lightly up the steps and into the
house; examined the flowers which stood in jars of
water in the pantry, called for vases, arranged a centre-piece
for the table, and carried other clusters of
blossoms into the little drawing-room, and others still
upstairs.</p>
<p>Then she returned to criticise the table and arrange
the name-cards. And, this accomplished, she ran upstairs
again to her own room, where her maid was
waiting.</p>
<p>Two or three times in a year&ndash;&ndash;not oftener&ndash;&ndash;Palla
yielded to a rare inclination which assailed her only
when unusually excited and happy. That inclination
was to whistle.</p>
<p>She whistled, now, while preparing for the bath;
whistled like a blackbird as she stood before the pier-glass
before the maid hooked her into a filmy, rosy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
evening gown&ndash;&ndash;her first touch of colour since assuming
mourning.</p>
<p>The bell rang, and the waitress brought an elaborate
florist&rsquo;s box. There were pink orchids in it and
Jim&rsquo;s card;&ndash;&ndash;perfection.</p>
<p>How could he have known! She wondered rapturously,
realising all the while that they&rsquo;d have gone
quite as well with her usual black.</p>
<p>Would he come early? She had forgotten to ask it.
Would he? For, in that event&ndash;&ndash;and considering his
inclination to take her into his arms&ndash;&ndash;she decided to
leave off the orchids until the more strenuous rites of
friendship had been accomplished.</p>
<p>She was carrying the orchids and the long pin attached,
in her left hand, when the sound of the doorbell
filled her with abrupt and delightful premonitions.
She ventured a glance over the banisters, then returned
hastily to the living room, where he discovered her and
did exactly what she had feared.</p>
<p>Her left hand, full of orchids, rested on his shoulder;
her cool, fresh lips rested on his. Then she retreated,
inviting inspection of the rosy dinner gown; and
fastened her orchids while he was admiring it.</p>
<p>Her guests began to arrive before either was quite
ready, so engrossed were they in happy gossip. And
Palla looked up in blank surprise that almost amounted
to vexation when the bell announced that their t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
was ended.</p>
<p>Shotwell had met the majority of Palla&rsquo;s dinner
guests. Seated on her right, he received from his
hostess information concerning some of those he did
not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That rather talkative boy with red hair is Larry
Rideout,&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;He edits a weekly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
called <i>The Coming Race</i>. The Post Office authorities
have refused to pass it through the mails. It&rsquo;s rather
advanced, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the girl on his right&ndash;&ndash;the one with the
chalky map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Questa Terrett. Don&rsquo;t you think her pallor is
fascinating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What particular stunt does she perform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be flippant. She writes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim! She writes poems. Haven&rsquo;t you seen any of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re rather modern poems. The lines don&rsquo;t rhyme
and there&rsquo;s no metrical form,&rdquo; explained Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they any good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a little difficult to understand. She leaves
out so many verbs and nouns&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. It&rsquo;s a part of her disease&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, please be careful. She is taken seriously&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken seriously ill? There, dear, I won&rsquo;t guy your
guests. What an absolutely deathly face she has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is considered beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has the profile of an Egyptian. She&rsquo;s as dead-white
as an Egyptian leper&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush it is, sweetness! Who&rsquo;s the good-looking chap
over by Ilse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stanley Wardner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his star trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a secessionist sculptor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is one of the ultra-modern men who has seceded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
from the Society of American Sculptors to form, with
a few others, a new group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he any good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said candidly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I am quite in sympathy with his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I understand him, he is what is termed, I believe,
a concentrationist. For instance, in a nude figure
which he is exhibiting in his studio, it&rsquo;s all a rough
block of marble except, in the middle of the upper part,
there is a nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, it is beautifully sculptured,&rdquo; insisted Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;good heavens!&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t there any other anatomical
feature to that block of marble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I explained that he is a concentrationist. His
school believes in concentrating on a single feature only,
and in rendering that feature as minutely and perfectly
as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim said: &ldquo;He looks as sane as a broker, too. You
never can tell, can you, sweetness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at several other people whose features
were not familiar, but Palla&rsquo;s explanations of her
friends had slightly discouraged him and he made no
further inquiries.</p>
<p>Vanya Tchernov was there, dreamy and sweet-mannered;
Estridge sat by Ilse, looking a trifle careworn,
as though hospital work were taking it out of
him. Marya Lanois was there, too, with her slightly
slanting green eyes and her tiger-red hair&ndash;&ndash;attracting
from him a curious sort of stealthy admiration, inexplicable
to him because he knew he was so entirely in
love with Palla.</p>
<p>A woman of forty sat on his right&ndash;&ndash;he promptly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
forgot her name each time he heard it&ndash;&ndash;who ate fastidiously
and chose birth-control as the subject for conversation.
And he dodged it in vain, for her conversation
had become a monologue, and he sat fiddling
with his food, very red, while the silky voice, so agreeable
in pitch and intonation, slid smoothly on.</p>
<p>Afterward Palla explained that she was a celebrated
sociologist, but Jim remained shy of her.</p>
<p>Other people came in after dinner. Vanya seated
himself at the piano and played from one of his unpublished
scores. Ilse sang two Scandinavian songs
in her fresh, wholesome, melodious voice&ndash;&ndash;the song
called <i>Ygdrasil</i>, and the <i>Song of Thokk</i>. Wardner had
brought a violin, and he and Vanya accompanied
Marya&rsquo;s Asiatic songs, but with some difficulty on the
sculptor&rsquo;s part, as modern instruments are scarcely
adapted to the sort of Russian music she chose to sing.</p>
<p>Marya had a way, when singing, which appeared
almost insolent. Seated, or carelessly erect, her supple
figure fell into lines of indolently provocative grace;
and the warm, golden notes welling from her throat
seemed to be flung broadcast and indifferently to her
listeners, as alms are often flung, without interest,
toward abstract poverty and not to the poor breathing
thing at one&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
<p>She sang, in her preoccupied way, one of her savage,
pentatonic songs, more Mongol than Cossack; then she
sang an impudent <i>burlatskiya</i> lazily defiant of her
listeners; then a so-called &ldquo;dancing song,&rdquo; in which
there was little restraint in word or air.</p>
<p>The subtly infernal enchantment of girl and music
was felt by everybody; but several among the illuminati
and the fair ultra-modernettes had now reached
their limit of breadth and tolerance, and were becoming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
bored and self-conscious, when abruptly Marya&rsquo;s figure
straightened to a lovely severity, her mouth opened
sweetly as a cherub&rsquo;s, and, looking up like a little,
ruddy bird, she sang one of the ancient <i>Kolyadki</i>,
Vanya alone understanding as his long, thin fingers
wandered instinctively into an improvised accompaniment:</p>

<p>Marya, her gemmed fingers bracketed on her hips, the
last sensuous note still afloat on her lips, turned her
head so that her rounded chin rested on her bare shoulder;
and looked at Shotwell. He rose, applauding with
the others, and found a chair for her.</p>
<p>But when she seated herself, she addressed Ilse on
the other side of him, leaning so near that he felt the
warmth of her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it wrestled with Loki? Was it Hel, goddess
of death? Or was it Thor who wrestled with that
toothless hag, Thokk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse explained.</p>
<p>The conversation became general, vaguely accompanied
by Vanya&rsquo;s drifting improvisations, where he
still sat at the piano, his lost gaze on Marya.</p>
<p>Bits of the chatter around him came vaguely to Shotwell&ndash;&ndash;the
birth-control lady&rsquo;s placid inclination toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
obstetrics; Wardner on concentration, with Palla
listening, bending forward, brown eyes wide and curious
and snowy hands framing her face; Ilse partly turned
where she was seated, alert, flushed, half smiling at what
John Estridge, behind her shoulder, was saying to her,&ndash;&ndash;some
improvised nonsense, of which Jim caught a
fragment:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;If he who dwells in Midgard<br />

And hope I shall not bore her<br />
If I tell Mistress Westgard<br />
How deeply I adore her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Through the hum of conversation and capricious
laughter, Vanya&rsquo;s vague music drifted like wind-blown
thistle-down, and his absent regard never left Marya,
where she rested among the cushions in low-voiced dialogue
with Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hoped,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;that you had perhaps
remembered me&ndash;&ndash;enough to stop for a word or two some
day at tea-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had had no intention of going; but he said that
he had meant to and would surely do so,&ndash;&ndash;the while she
was leisurely recognising the lie as it politely uncoiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo; she asked under her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo; She seemed amused: &ldquo;Tell
me, are you too a concentrationist?&rdquo; And her beryl-green
eyes barely flickered toward Palla. Then she
smiled and laid her hand lightly on her breast: &ldquo;I,
on the contrary, am a Diffusionist. It&rsquo;s merely a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
matter of how God grinds the lens. But prisms colour
one&rsquo;s dull white life so gaily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And split it up,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And disintegrate it,&rdquo; she nodded, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;so exquisitely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into rainbows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not believe that there is hidden gold there?&rdquo;
And, looking at him, she let one hand rest lightly
against her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I believe it,&rdquo; he said, laughing at her enchanting
effrontery. &ldquo;But, Marya, when the rainbow
goes a-glimmering, the same old grey world is there
again. It&rsquo;s always there&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awaiting another rainbow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But storms come first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is another rainbow not worth the storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we try?&rdquo; she asked carelessly.</p>
<p>He did not answer. But presently he looked across
at Vanya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there who would not love him?&rdquo; said Marya
serenely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need. All love Vanya. I, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so. For it is quite true.... Will you
come to tea alone with me some afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her; reddened. Marya turned her head
leisurely, to hear what Palla was saying to her. At the
sound of her voice, Jim turned also, and saw Palla
bending near his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she was saying to Marya, &ldquo;but Questa
Terrett desires to know Jim&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it any wonder,&rdquo; said Marya, &ldquo;that women should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
desire to know him? Alas!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She laughed and
turned to Ilse, who seated herself as Jim stood up.</p>
<p>Palla, her finger-tips resting lightly on his arm,
said laughingly: &ldquo;Our youthful and tawny enchantress
seemed unusually busy with you this evening. Has
she turned you into anything very disturbing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to come to earth and interfere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, has it gone as far as that!&rdquo; she
whispered in gay consternation. &ldquo;And could I really
arrive in time, though breathless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to stir from your
niche, sweetness. I swept your altar once. I&rsquo;ll keep
the fire clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You adorable thing&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He felt the faintest pressure
of her fingers; then he heard himself being presented
to Questa Terrett.</p>
<p>The frail and somewhat mortuary beauty of this
slim poetess, with her full-lipped profile of an Egyptian
temple-girl and her pale, still eyes, left him guessing&ndash;&ndash;rather
guiltily&ndash;&ndash;recollecting his recent but meaningless
disrespect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;just why you are here.
Soldiers are no novelty. Is somebody in love with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a toss-up whether he&rsquo;d wither or laugh, but
the demon of gaiety won out.</p>
<p>She also smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;because you seem to be
quite featureless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve a few eyes and noses and that sort&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean psychologically accentless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just plain man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That is all you are, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is,&rdquo; he admitted, quite as much amused
as she appeared to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Some crazy girl here is enamoured of you.
Otherwise, you scarcely belong among modern intellectuals,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he laughed outright.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;You really are delightful. You&rsquo;re just a
plain, fighting male, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t done much fighting&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unimaginative, too! You could have led yourself
to believe you had done a lot,&rdquo; she pointed out. &ldquo;And
maybe you could have interested me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. But suppose you try to interest <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;ve tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your best,&rdquo; he encouraged her cheerfully. &ldquo;You
never can be sure I&rsquo;m not listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she laughed: &ldquo;You nice youth,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;d talk that way to your sweetheart she&rsquo;d sit
up and listen.... Which I&rsquo;m afraid she doesn&rsquo;t,
so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt himself flushing, but he refused to wince
under her amused analysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve simply got to have imagination, you know,&rdquo;
she insisted. &ldquo;Otherwise, you don&rsquo;t get anywhere at
all. Have you read my smears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bacteriologists take a smear of something on a
glass slide and slip it under a microscope. My poems
are like that. The words are the bacteria. Few can
identify them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He maintained his gravity: &ldquo;Would you be kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
enough to take a smear and let me look?&rdquo; he inquired
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly: the experiment is called &lsquo;Unpremeditation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped one thin and silken knee over the other
and crossed her hands on it as she recited her poem.</p>

<p>Jim&rsquo;s features had become a trifle glassy. &ldquo;You do
skip a few words,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Words are animalcul&aelig;. Some skip, some gyrate,
some sub-divide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put a brave face on the matter: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not
really guying me,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;would you tell me
a little about your poem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; she replied amiably. &ldquo;To put it redundantly,
then, I have sketched in my poem a man
in the subway, with influenza, which infects others in
his vicinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose, smiled, and sauntered off, leaving him
utterly unable to determine whether or not he had
been outrageously imposed upon. Palla rescued him,
and he went with her, a little wild-eyed, downstairs to
the nearly empty and carpetless drawing-room, where
a music box was playing and people were already
dancing.</p>
<p>Toward midnight, Marya, passing Jim on her way
to the front door, leaned wide from Vanya&rsquo;s arm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us at least discuss my rainbow theory,&rdquo; she
said, laughing, and her face a shade too close to his;
and continued on, still clinging to the sleeve of Vanya&rsquo;s
fur-lined coat.</p>
<p>Ilse was the last to leave, with Estridge waiting
behind her to hold her wrap.</p>
<p>She came up to Palla, took both her hands in an
odd, subdued, wistful way.</p>
<p>After a moment she kissed her, and, close to her ear:
&ldquo;Wait, darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla did not understand.</p>
<p>Ilse said: &ldquo;I mean&ndash;&ndash;wait before you ever take any
step to&ndash;&ndash;to prove any theory&ndash;&ndash;or belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Palla did not comprehend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With&ndash;&ndash;Jim,&rdquo; said Ilse in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Why, of course. But&ndash;&ndash;it could never happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla said honestly: &ldquo;One reason is because he
wouldn&rsquo;t anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not be certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. I&rsquo;m absolutely certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse gazed at her, then laughed and pressed her hand.
&ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; asked Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I felt you shiver, dearest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse flushed and held out her arms for the sleeves
of her fur coat, which Estridge was holding.</p>
<p>They went away together, leaving Palla alone with
Shotwell, among the fading flowers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Puma, &ldquo;you are quite convinced he has
much wealth. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You betcha,&rdquo; replied Elmer Skidder. &ldquo;That
pious guy has got all kinds of it. Why, Alonzo D.
Pawling can buy you and me like we were two subway
tickets and then forget which pocket he put us in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He also is a sport? Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the quiet. Oh, I got his number some years ago.
Ran into him once in New York, where you used to
knock three times and ring twice before they slid the
panel on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bank president?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know one that didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; grinned
Skidder, inserting pearl studs in his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very bad&ndash;&ndash;for a shake-down,&rdquo; mused Puma,
smoothing his glossy top hat with one of Skidder&rsquo;s
silk mufflers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, you can&rsquo;t scare Alonzo D. Pawling. Say,
Angy, what dames have you commandeered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask Barclay and West. Also, they got another&ndash;&ndash;Vanna
Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she has a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skidder continued to attire himself in an over-braided
evening dress; Puma, seated behind him, gazed
absently at his partner&rsquo;s features reflected in the looking
glass.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A theatre on Broadway,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;You say he
has seemed interested, Elmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t run away screaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he behave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s hard to size up Alonzo D. Pawling. He&rsquo;s
a fly guy, Angy. What a man says at a little supper
for four, with a peach pulling his Depews and a good
looker sticking gardenias in his buttonhole, ain&rsquo;t what
he&rsquo;s likely to say next day in your office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have accompany him to Broadway and you
have shown him the parcel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You explain how we can not lose out? You mention
the option?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skidder cast aside his white tie and tried another,
constructed on the butterfly plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put the whole thing up to him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No
use stalling with Alonzo D. Pawling. I know him too
well. So I let out straight from the shoulder, and he
knows the scheme we&rsquo;ve got in mind and he knows we
want his money in it. That&rsquo;s how it stands to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma nodded and softly joined his over-manicured
finger-tips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We give him a good time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We give him
a little dinner like there never was in New York. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You betcha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barclay is a devil. You think she please him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alonzo D. Pawling is some bird himself,&rdquo; remarked
Skidder, picking up his hat and turning to Puma,
who rose with lithe briskness, put on his hat, and began
to pull at his white gloves.</p>
<p>They went down to the street, where Puma&rsquo;s car was
waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stop at the office a moment,&rdquo; he said, as they entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
the limousine. &ldquo;You need not get out, Elmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the studio he descended, saying to Skidder that
he&rsquo;d be back in a moment.</p>
<p>But it was very evident when he entered his office
that he had not expected to find Max Sondheim there;
and he hesitated on the threshold, his white-gloved
hand still on the door-knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Puma; I want to see you,&rdquo; growled Sondheim,
retaining his seat but pocketing <i>The Call</i>, which
he had been reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Puma coolly; &ldquo;I have no
time&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>now</i>!&rdquo; interrupted Sondheim.</p>
<p>They eyed each other for a moment in silence, then
Puma shrugged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But be quick, if you
please&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; interrupted the other in a menacing
voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re getting too damned independent, telling
me to be quick! I had a date with you here at five
o&rsquo;clock. You thought you wouldn&rsquo;t keep it and you
left at four-thirty. But I stuck around till you &rsquo;phoned
in that you&rsquo;d stop here to get some money. It&rsquo;s seven
o&rsquo;clock now, and I&rsquo;ve waited for you. And I guess
you&rsquo;ve got enough time to hear what I&rsquo;m going to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma looked at him without any expression at all
on his sanguine features. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I got to say to you is this,&rdquo; began Sondheim.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a kind of a club that uses our hall on
off nights. It&rsquo;s run by women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They meet this evening at eight in our hall,&ndash;&ndash;your
hall, if you choose.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>Puma nodded carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Put them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put &rsquo;em out!&rdquo; growled Sondheim. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want
them there to-night or any other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask me to evict respectable people who pay me
rent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you; I <i>tell</i> you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma turned a deep red: &ldquo;And whose hall do you
think it is?&rdquo; he demanded in a silky voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours. That&rsquo;s why I tell you to get rid of that
bunch and their Combat Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you ask me such a&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re fighting us and you know it. That&rsquo;s
a good enough reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not do so,&rdquo; said Puma, moistening his lips
with his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess you will when you think it over,&rdquo; sneered
Sondheim, getting up from his chair and stuffing his
newspaper into his overcoat pocket. He crossed the
floor and shot an ugly glance at Puma <i>en passant</i>.
Then he jerked open the door and went out briskly.</p>
<p>Puma walked into the inner waiting room, where a
telephone operator sat reading a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s McCabe?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes now, Governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The office manager sauntered up, eating a slice of
apple pie, and Puma stepped forward to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason have you permit Mr. Sondheim
to wait in my office?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said you told him to go in and wait there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a liar! Hereafter he shall wait out here.
You understand, McCabe?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. You&rsquo;re always out when he calls, ain&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma meditated a few moments: &ldquo;No. When he calls
you shall let me know. Then I decide. But he shall
not wait in my office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo; And, as Puma turned to go: &ldquo;The
police was here again this evening, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They heard of the row in the hall last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the muss was all swept up&ndash;&ndash;windows fixed and
the busted benches in the furnace, so I said there had
been no row as far as I knew, and I let &rsquo;em go in and
nose around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; said Puma, &ldquo;you shall say to them that
there was a very bad riot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big fight,&rdquo; continued Puma. &ldquo;And if there is
only a little damage you shall make more. And you
shall show it to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get you, Governor. I&rsquo;ll stage it right; don&rsquo;t
worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you shall stage it like there never was in
all of France any ruins like my hall! And afterward,&rdquo;
he said, half to himself, &ldquo;we shall see what we shall
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went back to his office, took a packet of hundred
dollar bills from the safe, and walked slowly out to
where the limousine awaited him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what the hell&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Skidder impatiently;
but Puma leaped lightly to his seat and pulled the fur
robe over his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, in excellent humour, &ldquo;we pick up Mr.
Pawling at the Astor.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They join us, Hotel Rajah. It will be, I trust,
an amusing evening.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>About midnight, dinner merged noisily into supper
in the private dining room reserved by Mr. Puma for
himself and guests at the new Hotel Rajah.</p>
<p>There had been intermittent dancing during the
dinner, but now the negro jazz specialists had been dismissed
with emoluments, and a music-box substituted;
and supper promised to become even a more lively repetition
of the earlier banquet.</p>
<p>Puma was superb&ndash;&ndash;a large, heavy man, he danced
as lightly as any ballerina; and he and Tessa Barclay
did a Paraguayan dance together, with a leisurely and
agile perfection of execution that elicited uproarious
demonstrations from the others.</p>
<p>Not a whit winded, Puma resumed his seat at table,
laughing as Mr. Pawling insisted on shaking hands
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are far too kind to my poor accomplishments,&rdquo;
he said in deprecation. &ldquo;It was not at all difficult, that
Paraguayan dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was art!&rdquo; insisted Mr. Pawling, his watery eyes
brimming with emotion. And he pressed the pretty
waist of Tessa Barclay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art,&rdquo; rejoined Puma, laying a jewelled hand on his
shirt-front, &ldquo;is an ecstatic outburst from within, like
the song of the bird. Art is simple; art is not difficult.
Where effort begins, art ends. Where self-expression
becomes a labour, art already has perished!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thumped his shirt-front with an impassioned and
highly-coloured fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is art?&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if it be not pleasure? And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
pleasure ceases where effort begins. For me, I am all
heart, all art, like there never was in all the history
of the Renaissance. As expresses itself the little innocent
bird in song, so in my pictures I express myself.
It is no effort. It is in me. It is born. Behold! Art
has given birth to Beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the result,&rdquo; added Skidder, &ldquo;is a <i>ne plus ultra
par excellence</i> which gathers in the popular coin every
time. And say, if we had a Broadway theatre to run
our stuff, and Angelo Puma to soopervise the combine&ndash;&ndash;oh
boy!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He smote Mr. Pawling upon his bony
back and dug him in the ribs with his thumb.</p>
<p>Mr. Pawling&rsquo;s mouth sagged and his melancholy
eyes shifted around him from Tessa Barclay&ndash;&ndash;who was
now attempting to balance a bon-bon on her nose and
catch it between her lips&ndash;&ndash;to Vanna Brown, teaching
Miss West to turn cart-wheels on one hand.</p>
<p>Evidently Art had its consolations; and the single
track genius who lived for art alone got a bonus, too.
Also, what General Sherman once said about Art
seemed to be only too obvious.</p>
<p>A detail, however, worried Mr. Pawling. Financially,
he had always been afraid of Jews. And the nose of
Angelo Puma made him uneasy every time he looked
at it.</p>
<p>But an inch is a mile on a man&rsquo;s nose; and his
own was bigger, yet entirely Yankee; so he had about
concluded that there was no racial occasion for financial
alarm.</p>
<p>What he should have known was that no Jew can
compete with a Connecticut Yankee; but that any
half-cast Armenian is master of both. Especially
when born in Mexico of a Levantine father.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>Now, in spite of Angelo Puma&rsquo;s agile gaiety and
exotic exuberances, his brain remained entirely occupied
with two matters. One of these concerned the
possibility of interesting Mr. Pawling in a plot of
ground on Broadway, now defaced by several taxpayers.</p>
<p>The other matter which fitfully preoccupied him was
his unpleasant and unintentional interview with Sondheim.</p>
<p>For it had come to a point, now, that the perpetual
bullying of former associates was worrying Mr. Puma
a great deal in his steadily increasing prosperity.</p>
<p>The war was over. Besides, long ago he had prudently
broken both his pledged word and his dangerous
connections in Mexico, and had started what he believed
to be a safe and legitimate career in New York,
entirely free from perilous affiliations.</p>
<p>Government had investigated his activities; Government
had found nothing for which to order his internment
as an enemy alien.</p>
<p>It had been a close call. Puma realised that. But
he had also realised that there was no law in Mexico
ten miles outside of Mexico City;&ndash;&ndash;no longer any German
power there, either;&ndash;&ndash;when he severed all connections
with those who had sent him into the United
States camouflaged as a cinema promoter, and under
instruction to do all the damage he could to everything
American.</p>
<p>But he had not counted on renewing his acquaintance
with Karl Kastner and Max Sondheim in New
York. Nor did they reveal themselves to him until he
had become too prosperous to denounce them and risk
investigation and internment under the counter-accusations
with which they coolly threatened him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>So, from the early days of his prosperity in New
York, it had been necessary for him to come to an
agreement with Sondheim and Kastner. And the more
his prosperity increased the less he dared to resent
their petty tyranny and blackmail, because, whether or
not they might suffer under his public accusations, it
was very certain that internment, if not imprisonment
for a term of years, would be the fate reserved for himself.
And that, of course, meant ruin.</p>
<p>So, although Puma ate and drank and danced with
apparent abandon, and flashed his dazzling smile over
everybody and everything, his mind, when not occupied
by Alonzo D. Pawling, was bothered by surmises concerning
Sondheim. And also, at intervals, he thought
of Palla Dumont and the Combat Club, and he wondered
uneasily whether Sondheim&rsquo;s agents had attempted
to make any trouble at the meeting in his hall
that evening.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There had been some trouble. The meeting being
a public one, under municipal permission, Kastner had
sent a number of his Bolshevik followers there, instructed
to make what mischief they could. They were
recruited from all sects of the Reds, including the American
Bolsheviki, known commonly as the I. W. W. Also,
among them were scattered a few pacifists, hun-sympathisers,
conscientious objectors and other birds of
analogous plumage, quite ready for interruptions and
debate.</p>
<p>Palla presided, always a trifle frightened to find
herself facing any audience, but ashamed to avoid the
delegated responsibility.</p>
<p>Among others on the platform around her were Ilse
and Marya and Questa Terrett and the birth-control
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
lady&ndash;&ndash;Miss Thane&ndash;&ndash;neat and placid and precise as
usual, and wearing long-distance spectacles for a more
minute inspection of the audience.</p>
<p>Palla opened the proceedings in a voice which was
clear, and always became steadier under heckling.</p>
<p>Her favourite proposition&ndash;&ndash;the Law of Love and Service&ndash;&ndash;she
offered with such winning candour that the
interruption of derisive laughter, prepared by several
of Kastner&rsquo;s friends, was postponed; and Terry Hogan,
I. W. W., said to Jerry Smith, I. W. W.:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God love her, she&rsquo;s but a baby. Lave her chatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, a conscientious objector got up and asked
her whether she considered that the American army
abroad had conformed to her Law of Love and Service,
and when she answered emphatically that every soldier
in the United States army was fulfilling to the highest
degree his obligations to that law, both pacifists and
conscientious objectors dissented noisily, and a student
from Columbia College got up and began to harangue
the audience.</p>
<p>Order was finally obtained: Palla added a word or
two and retired; and Ilse Westgard came forward.</p>
<p>Somebody in the audience called out: &ldquo;Say, just because
you&rsquo;re a good-looker it don&rsquo;t mean you got a
brain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse threw back her golden head and her healthy
laughter rang uncontrolled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comrade,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we all have to do the best we
can with what brain we have, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; came from her grinning heckler, who seemed
quite won over by her good humour.</p>
<p>So, an armistice established, Ilse plunged vigorously
into her theme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you something which you all know in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
your hearts: any class revolution based on violence and
terrorism is doomed to failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that!&rdquo; shouted a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it. And you will never see any reign
of terror in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you may see Bolshevism here&ndash;&ndash;Bolshevist propaganda&ndash;&ndash;Bolshevist
ideas penetrating. You may see
these ideas accepted by Labor. You may see strikes&ndash;&ndash;the
most senseless and obsolete weapon ever wielded
by thinking men; you may see panics, tie-ups, stagnation,
misery. But you never shall see Bolshevism triumphant
here, or permanently triumphant anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Bolshevism is autocracy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hell it is!&rdquo; yelled an I. W. W.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ilse cheerfully, &ldquo;as you have said it
is hell. And hell is an end, not a means, not a remedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is the negation of all socialism; the death
of civilisation. And civilisation has an immortal destiny;
and that destiny is socialism!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man interrupted, but she asked him so sweetly for
a few moments more that he reseated himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know something about Bolshevism
and revolution. I was a soldier of Russia.
I carried a rifle and full pack. I was part of what is
history. And I learned to be tolerant in the trenches;
and I learned to love this unhappy human race of ours.
And I learned what is Bolshevism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of many protests against the exploitation
of men by men. It is one of the many reactions against
intolerable wrong. It is not a policy; it is an outburst
against injustice; against the stupidity of present conditions,
where the few monopolise the wealth created by
the many; and the many remain poor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bolshevism is the remedy proposed&ndash;&ndash;the violent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
superimposition of a brand new autocracy upon
the ruins of the old!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not work. It never can work, because it
imposes the will of one class upon all other classes.
It excludes all parties excepting its own from government.
It is, therefore, not democratic. It is a tyranny,
imposing upon capital and labour alike its will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I tell you that Labour has just won the greatest
of all wars. Do you suppose Labour will endure the
autocracy of the Bolsheviki? The time is here when
a more decent division is going to be made between
the employer and the labourer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what sort of production it may be,
the producer is going to receive a much larger share;
the employer a much smaller. And the producer is
going to enjoy a better standard of living, opportunities
for leisure and self-cultivation; and the three spectres
that haunt him from childhood to grave&ndash;&ndash;lack of
money to make a beginning; fear for a family left on
its own resources by his death; terror of poverty in
old age&ndash;&ndash;shall vanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against these three evil ghosts that haunt his bedside
when the long day is done, there are going to be
guarantees. Because those who won for us this righteous
war, whether abroad or at home, are going to
have something to say about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it will be they, not the Bolsheviki&ndash;&ndash;it will
be labourer and employer, not incendiary and assassin,
who shall determine what is to be the policy of this
Republic toward those to whom it owes its salvation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man stood up waving his arms: &ldquo;All right! All
right! The question is whether the sort of government
we have is worth saving. You talk very flip
about the Bolsheviki, but I&rsquo;ll tell you they&rsquo;ll run this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
country yet, and every other too, and run &rsquo;em to suit
themselves! It&rsquo;s our turn; you&rsquo;ve had your inning.
Now, you&rsquo;ll get a dose of what you hand to us if we
have to ram it down with a gun barrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was wild cheering from Kastner&rsquo;s men scattered
about the hall; cries of &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff! Take away
their dough! Kick &rsquo;em out of their Fifth Avenue
castles and set &rsquo;em to digging subways!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse said calmly: &ldquo;Thank you very much for proving
my contention for all these people who have been so
kind as to listen to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said to you that Bolshevism is merely a new and
more immoral autocracy which wishes to confiscate all
property, annihilate all culture and set up in the public
places a new god&ndash;&ndash;the god of Ignorance!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been good enough to corroborate me. And
I and my audience now know that Bolshevism is on its
way to America, and that its agents are already here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in view of such a danger that this Combat Club
has been organised. And it was time to organise it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is evident, too, that the newspapers agree with
us. Let us read you what one of them has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We fully realise the atrocity of the Bolshevik propaganda,
which is really the doctrine of communism and
anarchy. We realise the perilous ferment which endangers
civilisation. But in the countries which have
held fast to moral standards during the war we believe
the factors of safety are sufficiently great, the forces of
sanity are far stronger than those of chaos&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, those whose r&ocirc;le it was to interrupt with derisive
laughter, broke out at a preconcerted signal.
But Ilse read on:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In a word, as a mere matter of self-interest and
common sense, we can only see the people, as a whole,
in any country, as opposed to anarchy in any form. In
our own land, even granted that there are a hundred
thousand &rdquo;red&ldquo; agitators, or say a quarter of a million&ndash;&ndash;and
we have no real belief that this is so&ndash;&ndash;what are
these in a population of one hundred and five millions?
Are the ninety and nine sane, moral, law abiding men
and women going to allow themselves to be stampeded
into ruin by a handful of criminals and lunatics?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We do not for a moment believe it. These agitators
and incendiaries have a sort of maniacal impetus that
fills the air with dust and noise and alarms the credulous.
Perhaps it may be wise to counteract this with a
little quiet promotion of ideas of safety and prosperity,
based on order and law. It may be well to calm the
nerves of the timorous and it can do no harm to set in
motion a counter wave of horror and repulsion against
those who are planning to lead the world back to conditions
of tribal savagery. Educational work is always
beneficent. Let us have much of that but no panic.
The power of truth and reason is in calm confidence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now a bushy-headed man got on his feet and
levelled his forefinger at Ilse: &ldquo;Take shame for your-selluf!&rdquo;
he shouted. &ldquo;I know you! You fought mit
Korniloff! You took orders from Kerensky, from aristocrats,
from cadets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse said pleasantly. &ldquo;I fought for Russia, my friend.
And when the robbers and despoilers of Russia became
the stronger, I took a vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some people laughed, but a harsh voice cried: &ldquo;We
know what you did. You rescued the friend of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
Romanoffs&ndash;&ndash;that Carmelite nun up there on the platform
behind you, who calls herself Miss Dumont!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And from the other side of the hall another man
bawled out: &ldquo;You and the White Nun have done enough
mischief. And you and your club had better get out
of here while the going is good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estridge, who was standing in the rear of the hall
with Shotwell, came down along the aisle. Jim followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; he demanded, scanning the faces
on that side while Shotwell looked among the seats
beyond.</p>
<p>Nobody said anything, for John Estridge stood over
six feet and Jim looked physically very fit.</p>
<p>Estridge, standing in the aisle, said in his cool, penetrating
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This club is a forum for discussion. All are free
to argue any point. Only swine would threaten violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go on and argue. Say what you like. But
the next man who threatens these ladies or this club
with violence will have to leave the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll put him out?&rdquo; piped an unidentified voice.</p>
<p>Then the two young men laughed; and their mirth
was not reassuring to the violently inclined.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There were disturbances during the evening, but no
violence, and only a few threats&ndash;&ndash;those that made them
remaining in prudent incognito.</p>
<p>Miss Thane made a serene, precise and perfectly
logical address upon birth control.</p>
<p>Somebody yelled that the millionaires didn&rsquo;t have to
resort to it, being already sufficiently sterile to assure
the dwindling of their class.</p>
<p>A woman rose and said she had always done what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
she pleased in the matter, law or no law, but that if it
were true the Bolsheviki in America were but a quarter
of a million to a hundred million of the bourgeoisie,
then it was time to breed and breed to the limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let the kids starve?&rdquo; cried another woman&ndash;&ndash;a
mere girl. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the way. The way to do is to
even things with a hundred million hand grenades!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the place was in an uproar; but Palla
came forward and said that the meeting was over, and
Estridge and Shotwell and two policemen kept the
aisles fairly clear while the wrangling audience made
their way to the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, it&rsquo;s all lollipop!&rdquo; said a man. &ldquo;What d&rsquo; yeh
expect from a bunch of women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Flag Club is better,&rdquo; rejoined another.
&ldquo;Say, bo! There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; doin&rsquo; when Sondheim
hands it out!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Ilse went away with Estridge. Palla came along
among the other women, and turned aside to offer her
hand to Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you expect to take me home?&rdquo; she asked demurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you expect me to?&rdquo; he inquired uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Why should I?&rdquo; She slipped her arm into his
with a little nestling gesture. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a very odd
thing, Jim, that they left the chafing dish on the table.
And that before she went to bed my waitress laid
covers for two.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you worried about this Dumont girl?&rdquo; asked
Shotwell Senior abruptly.</p>
<p>His wife did not look up from her book.
After an interval:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband watched her over the top of his newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s anything in it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a shame that Jim should worry you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he doesn&rsquo;t, but what&rsquo;s the difference?
You&rsquo;re unhappy and he&rsquo;s the reason of it. And it isn&rsquo;t
as though he were a cub any longer, either. He&rsquo;s old
enough to know what he&rsquo;s about. He&rsquo;s no Willy
Baxter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what makes me anxious,&rdquo; said Helen Shotwell.
&ldquo;Do you know, dear, that he hasn&rsquo;t dined here
once this week, yet he seems to go nowhere else&ndash;&ndash;nowhere
except to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of woman is she?&rdquo; he demanded, wiping
his eyeglasses as though preparing to take a long-distance
look at Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know her only at the Red Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, is she at all common?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.... That is why it is difficult for me to
talk to Jim about her. There&rsquo;s nothing of that sort
to criticise.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No social objections to the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None. She&rsquo;s an unusual girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attractive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, James, I <i>want</i> him to marry Elorn! And if
he&rsquo;s going to make himself conspicuous over this
Dumont girl, I don&rsquo;t think I can bear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> the objection to the girl, Helen?&rdquo; he asked,
flinging his paper onto a table and drawing nearer
the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t at all our kind, James&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you just said&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean socially. And still, as far as that
goes, she seems to care nothing whatever for position
or social duties or obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so unusual in these days,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Lots of nice girls are fed up on the social aspects of
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for example, she has not made the slightest
effort to know anybody worth knowing. Janet Speedwell
left cards and then asked her to dinner, and received
an amiable regret for her pains. No girl can
afford to decline invitations from Janet, even if her
excuse is a club meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And two or three other women at the Red Cross
have asked her to lunch at the Colony Club, and have
made advances to her on Leila Vance&rsquo;s account, but she
hasn&rsquo;t responded. Now, you know a girl isn&rsquo;t going
to get on by politely ignoring the advances of such
women. But she doesn&rsquo;t even appear to be aware of
their importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask her to something?&rdquo; suggested
her husband.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; she said, a little sharply. &ldquo;I asked her and
Leila Vance to dine with us. I intended to ask Elorn,
too, and let Jim realise the difference if he isn&rsquo;t already
too blind to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she decline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; said Helen curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened that she had asked somebody to dine
with her that evening. And I have a horrid suspicion
it was Jim. If it was, she could have postponed it.
Of course it was a valid excuse, but it annoyed me to
have her decline. That&rsquo;s what I tell you, James, she
has a most disturbing habit of declining overtures
from everybody&ndash;&ndash;even from&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen checked herself, looked at her husband with an
odd smile, in which there was no mirth; then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably are not aware of it, dear, but that
girl has also declined Jim&rsquo;s overtures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Invitation to do what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell Senior turned very red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil she did! How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she turned him down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She declined to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband seemed unable to grasp such a fact.
Never had it occurred to Shotwell Senior that any
living, human girl could decline such an invitation
from his only son.</p>
<p>After a painful silence: &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said in a perplexed
and mortified voice, &ldquo;she certainly seems to be,
as you say, a most unusual girl.... But&ndash;&ndash;if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
it&rsquo;s settled&ndash;&ndash;why do you continue to worry, Helen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Jim is very deeply in love with her....
And I&rsquo;m sore at heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard hit, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shotwell Senior reddened again: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to face
it,&rdquo; he said.... &ldquo;But that girl seems to be a
fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl may change her mind.&rdquo; She lifted her head
and looked with sad humour at her husband, whom she
also had kept dangling for a while. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;James, dear, our son <i>is</i> as fine as we think him.
But he&rsquo;s just a splendid, wholesome, everyday, unimaginative
New York business man. And he&rsquo;s fallen in
love with his absolute antithesis. Because this girl is
all ardent imagination, full of extravagant impulses,
very lovely to look at, but a perfectly illogical fanatic!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vance has told me all about her. She really
belongs in some exotic romance, not in New York. She&rsquo;s
entirely irresponsible, perfectly unstable. There is in
her a generous sort of recklessness which is quite likely
to drive her headlong into any extreme. And what
sort of mate would such a girl be for a young man
whose ambition is to make good in the real estate
business, marry a nice girl, have a pleasant home and
agreeable children, and otherwise conform to the
ordinary conventions of civilisation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; remarked her husband grimly, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;d
keep him guessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would indeed! And that&rsquo;s not all, James. For
I&rsquo;ve got to tell you that the girl entertains some rather
weird and dreadful socialistic notions. She talks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
socialism&ndash;&ndash;a mild variety&ndash;&ndash;from public platforms. She
admits very frankly that she entertains no respect for
accepted conventions. And while I have no reason to
doubt her purity of mind and personal chastity, the
unpleasant and startling fact remains that she proposes
that humanity should dispense with the marriage ceremony
and discard it and any orthodox religion as
obsolete superstitions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he began, then got frightfully
red in the face once more. &ldquo;What that girl needs
is a plain spanking!&rdquo; he said bluntly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see
her or any other girl try to come into this family on
any such ridiculous terms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to come in on any terms,&rdquo;
said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are you worrying about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am worrying about what might happen if she
ever changed her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you say she doesn&rsquo;t believe in marriage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that boy of ours isn&rsquo;t crazy,&rdquo; insisted Shotwell
Senior.</p>
<p>But his mother remained silent in her deep misgiving
concerning the sanity of the simpler sex, when mentally
upset by love. For it seemed very difficult to understand
what to do&ndash;&ndash;if, indeed, there was anything for
her to do in the matter.</p>
<p>To express disapproval of Palla to Jim or to the
girl herself&ndash;&ndash;to show any opposition at all&ndash;&ndash;would,
she feared, merely defeat its own purpose and alienate
her son&rsquo;s confidence.</p>
<p>The situation was certainly a most disturbing one,
though not at present perilous.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>And Helen would not permit herself to believe that
it could ever really become an impossible situation&ndash;&ndash;that
this young girl would deliberately slap civilisation
in the face; or that her only son would add a kick
to the silly assault and take the ruinous consequences
of social ostracism.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The young girl in question was at that moment
seated before her piano, her charming head uplifted,
singing in the silvery voice of an immaculate angel,
to her own accompaniment, the heavenly Mass of Saint
Hild&eacute;:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Love me,<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>Adorable Mother!<br />
<span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>Mary,<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>I worship no other.<br />
<span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>Save me,<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>O, graciously save me<br />
<span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>I pray!<br />
Let my Darkness be turned into Day<br />
By the Light of Thy Grace<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>And Thy Face,<br />
<span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>I pray!&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>She continued the exquisite refrain on the keys for
a while, then slowly turned to the man beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one Mass I still love,&rdquo; she murmured absently,
&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;memories of childhood, I suppose&ndash;&ndash;when the Sisters
made me sing the solo&ndash;&ndash;I was only ten years old.&rdquo;
... She shrugged her shoulders: &ldquo;You know, in
those days, I was a little devil,&rdquo; she said seriously.</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really was, Jim,&ndash;&ndash;all over everything and wild
as a swallow. I led the pack; Shadow Hill held us in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
horror. I remember I fought our butcher&rsquo;s boy once&ndash;&ndash;right
in the middle of the street&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did something to a cat which I couldn&rsquo;t stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you whip him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, it was horrid. We both were dreadfully
battered. And the constable caught us both, and I
shall never, never forget my mother&rsquo;s face!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gazed down at the keys of the piano, touched
them pensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very deuce was in me,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Even
now, unless I&rsquo;m occupied with all my might, something
begins&ndash;&ndash;to simmer in me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and looked at him: &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;A sort of enchanted
madness that makes me wild to seize the whole
world and set it right!&ndash;&ndash;take it into my arms and defend
it&ndash;&ndash;die for it&ndash;&ndash;or slay it and end its pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much of an armful,&rdquo; he said with great gravity.
&ldquo;The thing to do is to select an individual and take
<i>him</i> to your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And slay him?&rdquo; she inquired gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&ndash;&ndash;like the feminine mantis&ndash;&ndash;if you find
you don&rsquo;t like him. Individual suitors must take their
chances of being either eaten or adored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, you&rsquo;re so funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swung her stool, rested her elbow on the piano,
and gazed at him interrogatively, the odd, half-smile
edging her lips and eyes. And, after a little <i>duetto</i>
of silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I shall ever come to care for you&ndash;&ndash;imprudently?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you help it? And, as far as that goes,
how could I, if it happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ever come to care at all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
care enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the trouble with you,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t care enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight flush stained his cheek-bones: &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I almost wish I cared less. And that would
be what you call enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colour came into her face, too:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Jim, I really don&rsquo;t know how much I
do care for you? It sounds rather silly, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you care more than you did at first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I don&rsquo;t know how much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough to marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we discuss that again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up, went out to the hall, pulled a book from
his overcoat pocket, and returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care to hear what the greatest American
says on the subject, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the subject of marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he takes the marriage for granted. It&rsquo;s what
he has to say concerning the obligations involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceed, dear,&rdquo; she said, laughingly.</p>
<p>He read, eliminating what was not necessary to make
his point:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A race is worthless and contemptible if its men
cease to work hard and, at need, to fight hard; and if
its women cease to breed freely. If the best classes do
not reproduce themselves the nation will, of course, go
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the ordinary decent man does not understand
that to marry the woman he loves, as early as
he can, is the most desirable of all goals; when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
ordinary woman does not understand that all other
forms of life are but makeshift substitutes for the life
of the wife, the mother of healthy children; then the
State is rotten at heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The woman who shrinks from motherhood is as low
a creature as a man of the professional pacifist, or
poltroon, type, who shirks his duty as a soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The only full life for man or woman is led by
those men and women who together, with hearts both
gentle and valiant, face lives of love and duty, who see
their children rise up to call them blessed, and who
leave behind them their seed to inherit the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No celibate life approaches such a life in usefulness.
The mother comes ahead of the nun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if the average woman does not marry and
become the mother of enough healthy children to permit
the increase of the race; and if the average man
does not marry in times of peace and do his full duty
in war if need arises, then the race is decadent and
should be swept aside to make room for a better one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only that nation has a future whose sons and
daughters recognise and obey the primary laws of their
racial being!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed the book and laid it on the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;either we&rsquo;re really a rotten and
decadent race, and might as well behave like one, or
we&rsquo;re sound and sane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something unusual in his voice&ndash;&ndash;in the sudden grim
whiteness of his face&ndash;&ndash;disturbed Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to marry me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You care for
no other man. And if you don&rsquo;t love me enough to
do it, you&rsquo;ll learn to afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she said gently, and now rather white herself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
&ldquo;that is an outrageous thing to say to me. Don&rsquo;t you
realise it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. But I love you&ndash;&ndash;I need you so that I&rsquo;m
fit for nothing else. I can&rsquo;t keep my mind on my
work; I can&rsquo;t think of anybody&ndash;&ndash;anything but you....
If you didn&rsquo;t care for me more or less I
wouldn&rsquo;t come whining to you. I wouldn&rsquo;t come now
until I&rsquo;d entirely won your heart&ndash;&ndash;except that&ndash;&ndash;if I
did&ndash;&ndash;and if you refused me marriage and offered the
other thing&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d be about through with everything!
And I&rsquo;d know damned well that the nation wasn&rsquo;t worth
the powder to blow it to hell if such women as you
betray it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl flushed furiously; but her voice seemed fairly
under control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better go, Jim, before you say anything
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up very straight, unstirring, for a long
time, not looking at her.</p>
<p>Then he said &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; in a low voice, and went
out leaving her quite pale again and rather badly
scared.</p>
<p>As the lower door closed, she sprang to the landing
and called his name in a frightened voice that had no
carrying power.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Later she telephoned to his several clubs. At eleven
she called each club again; and finally telephoned to
his house.</p>
<p>At midnight he had not telephoned in reply to the
messages she had left requesting him to call her.</p>
<p>Her anxiety had changed to a vague bewilderment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
Her dismayed resentment at what he had said to her
was giving place to a strange and unaccustomed sense
of loneliness.</p>
<p>Suddenly an overwhelming desire to be with Ilse
seized her, and she would have called a taxi and started
immediately, except for the dread that Jim might telephone
in her absence.</p>
<p>Yet, she didn&rsquo;t know what it was that she wanted of
him, except to protest at his attitude toward her. Such
a protest was due them both&ndash;&ndash;an appeal in behalf of the
friendship which meant so much to her&ndash;&ndash;which, she
had abruptly discovered, meant far more to her than
she supposed.</p>
<p>At midnight she telephoned to Ilse. A sleepy maid
replied that Miss Westgard had not yet returned.</p>
<p>So Palla called a taxi, pinned on her hat and struggled
into her fur coat, and, taking her latch-key,
started for Ilse&rsquo;s apartment, feeling need of her in a
blind sort of way&ndash;&ndash;desiring to listen to her friendly
voice, touch her, hear her clear, sane laughter.</p>
<p>A yawning maid admitted her. Miss Westgard had
dined out with Mr. Estridge, but had not yet returned.</p>
<p>So Palla, wondering a little, laid aside her coat and
went into the pretty living room.</p>
<p>There were books and magazines enough, but after
a while she gave up trying to read and sat staring
absently at a photograph of Estridge in uniform, which
stood on the table at her elbow.</p>
<p>Across it was an inscription, dated only a few days
back: &ldquo;To Ilse from Jack, on the road to Asgard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as she gazed at the man&rsquo;s handsome features,
for the first time a vague sense of uneasiness invaded
her.</p>
<p>Of a gradually growing comradeship between these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
two she had been tranquilly aware. And yet, now, it
surprised her to realise that their comradeship had
drifted into intimacy.</p>
<p>Lying back in her armchair, her thoughts hovered
about these two; and she went back in her mind to
recollect something of the beginning of this intimacy;&ndash;&ndash;and
remembered various little incidents which, at the
time, seemed of no portent.</p>
<p>And, reflecting, she recollected now what Ilse had
said to her after the last party she had given&ndash;&ndash;and
which Palla had not understood.</p>
<p>What had Ilse meant by asking her to &ldquo;wait&rdquo;? Wait
for what?... Where was Ilse, now? Why did
she remain out so late with John Estridge? It was
after one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Of course they must be dancing somewhere or other.
There were plenty of dances to go to.</p>
<p>Palla stirred restlessly in her chair. Evidently Ilse
had not told her maid that she meant to be out late,
for the girl seemed to have expected her an hour ago.</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s increasing restlessness finally drove her to
the windows, where she pulled aside the shades and
stood looking out into the silent night.</p>
<p>The night was cold and clear and very still. Rarely
a footfarer passed; seldom a car. And the stillness of
the dark city increased her nervousness.</p>
<p>New York has rare phases of uncanny silence, when,
for a space, no sound disturbs the weird stillness.</p>
<p>The clang of trains, the feathery whirr of motors,
the echo of footsteps, the immense, indefinable breathing
vibration of the iron monster, drowsing on its rock between
three rivers and the sea, ceases utterly. And a vast
stillness reigns, mournful, ominous, unutterably sad.</p>
<p>Palla looked down into the empty street. The dark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
chill of it seemed to rise and touch her; and she shivered
unconsciously and turned back into the lighted room.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was two o&rsquo;clock. Her eyes were heavy, her heart
heavier. Why should everything suddenly happen to
her in that way? Where had Jim gone when he left
her? And who was it answered the telephone at his
house when she had called up and asked to speak to him?
It was a woman&rsquo;s voice&ndash;&ndash;a maid, no doubt&ndash;&ndash;yet, for
an instant, she had fancied that the voice resembled
his mother&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But it couldn&rsquo;t have been, for Palla had given her
name, and Mrs. Shotwell would have spoken to her&ndash;&ndash;unless&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
his mother&ndash;&ndash;disapproved of something&ndash;&ndash;of
her calling Jim at such an hour.... Or of
something ... perhaps of their friendship ...
of herself, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She heard the clock strike and looked across at the
mantel.</p>
<p>What was Ilse doing at half-past two in the morning?
Where could she be?</p>
<p>Palla involuntarily turned her head and looked at
the photograph. Of course Ilse was safe with a man
like John Estridge.... That is to say ...</p>
<p>Without warning, her face grew hot and the crimson
tide mounted to the roots of her hair, dyeing throat
and temples.</p>
<p>A sort of stunning reaction followed as the tide
ebbed; she found herself stupidly repeating the word
&ldquo;safe,&rdquo; as though to interpret what it meant.</p>
<p>Safe? Yes, Ilse was safe. She knew how to take
care of herself ... unless....</p>
<p>Again the crimson tide invaded her skin to the
temples.... A sudden and haunting fear came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
creeping after it had ebbed once more, leaving her
gazing fixedly into space through the tumult of her
thoughts. And always in dull, unmeaning repetition
the word &ldquo;safe&rdquo; throbbed in her ears.</p>
<p>Safe? Safe from what? From the creed they both
professed? From their common belief? From the consequences
of living up to it?</p>
<p>At the thought, Palla sprang to her feet and stood
quivering all over, both hands pressed to her throat,
which was quivering too.</p>
<p>Where was Ilse? What had happened? Had she
suddenly come face to face with that creed of theirs&ndash;&ndash;that
shadowy creed which they believed in, perhaps
because it seemed so unreal!&ndash;&ndash;because the ordeal by
fire seemed so vague, so far away in that ghostly
bourne which is called the future, and which remains
always so inconceivably distant to the young&ndash;&ndash;star-distant,
remote as inter-stellar dust&ndash;&ndash;aloof as death.</p>
<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock. There were velvet-dark smears
under Palla&rsquo;s eyes, little colour in her lips. The weight of
fatigue lay heavily on her young shoulders; on her mind,
too, partly stupefied by the violence of her emotions.</p>
<p>Once she had risen heavily, had gone into the maid&rsquo;s
room and had told her to go to bed, adding that she
herself would wait for Miss Westgard.</p>
<p>That, already, was nearly an hour ago, and the gilt
hands of the clock were already creeping around the
gilded dial toward the half hour.</p>
<p>As it struck on the clear French bell, a key turned
in the outside door; then the door closed; and Palla
rose trembling from her chair as Ilse entered, her
golden hair in lovely disorder, the evening cloak partly
flung from her shoulders.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s utter silence. Then Ilse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
stepped swiftly forward and took Palla in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling! What has happened?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Why are you here at this hour? You look dreadfully
ill!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s head dropped on her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; whispered Ilse. &ldquo;Darling&ndash;&ndash;darling&ndash;&ndash;you
did&ndash;&ndash;you did wait&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s voice was scarcely audible: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what you mean.... I was only frightened about
you.... I&rsquo;ve been so unhappy.... And Jim
said&ndash;&ndash;good-bye&ndash;&ndash;and I can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;find him&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to answer me! Are you in love with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.... I don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;think so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, Palla seemed to understand what
Ilse had meant when she had said, &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she lifted her head and looked blindly into the
sea-blue eyes&ndash;&ndash;blindly, desperately, striving to see
through those clear soul-windows what it might be
that was looking out at her.</p>
<p>And, gazing, she knew that she dared not ask Ilse
where she had been.</p>
<p>The latter smiled; but her voice was very tender
when she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll telephone your maid in the morning. You
must go to bed, Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse turned carelessly and laid her cloak across a
chair. There was a second chamber beyond her own.
She went into it, turned down the bed and called Palla,
who came slowly after her.</p>
<p>They kissed each other in silence. Then Ilse went
back to her own room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;Miss Dumont called you
on the telephone at an unusual hour last night.
You had gone to your room, and on the chance
that you were asleep I did not speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all&ndash;&ndash;sufficient explanation to discount any
reproach from her son incident on his comparing notes
with the girl in question. Also just enough in her
action to convey to the girl a polite hint that the Shotwell
family was not at home to people who telephoned
at that unconventional hour.</p>
<p>On his way to business that morning, Jim telephoned
to Palla, but, learning she was not at home, let the
matter rest.</p>
<p>In his sullen and resentful mood he no longer cared&ndash;&ndash;or
thought he didn&rsquo;t, which resulted in the same
thing&ndash;&ndash;the accumulation of increasing bitterness during
a dull, rainy working day at the office, and a dogged
determination to keep clear of this woman until effort
to remain away from her was no longer necessary.</p>
<p>For the thing was utterly hopeless; he&rsquo;d had enough.
And in his bruised heart and outraged common sense
he was boyishly framing an indictment of modern
womanhood&ndash;&ndash;lumping it all and cursing it out&ndash;&ndash;swearing
internally at the entire enfranchised pack which
the war had set afoot and had licensed to swarm all
over everything and raise hell with the ancient and
established order of things.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>The stormy dark came early; and in this frame of
mind when he left the office he sulkily avoided the club.</p>
<p>He very rarely drank anything; but, not knowing
what to do, he drifted into the Biltmore bar.</p>
<p>He met a man or two he knew, but declined all suggestions
for the evening, turned up his overcoat collar,
and started through the hotel toward the northern exit.</p>
<p>And met Marya Lanois face to face.</p>
<p>She was coming from the tea-room with two or three
other people, but turned immediately on seeing him
and came toward him with hand extended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you look very wet. And you
don&rsquo;t look particularly well. Have you arrived all
alone for tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had my tea in the bar,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How are you,
Marya?&ndash;&ndash;but I musn&rsquo;t detain you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he glanced at
the distant group of people who seemed to be awaiting
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not detaining me,&rdquo; she said sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your people seem to be waiting&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may go to the deuce. Are you quite alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we have tea together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve had yours&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know there are other things that one
sometimes drinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed no way out of it. They went into the
tea-room together and seated themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is Vanya?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanya gives a concert to-night in Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It was rainy. Besides, I hear Vanya play
when I desire to hear him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their order was served.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So you wouldn&rsquo;t go to Baltimore,&rdquo; said Jim smilingly.
&ldquo;It strikes me, Marya, that you can be a coldblooded
girl when you wish to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, what do you know about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed: &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;ve got your
number&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Because I have many numbers. I am a complicated
combination,&rdquo; she added, smiling; &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;yet after
all, a combination only. And quite simple when one
discovers the key to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what it is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laughed. Marya, particularly, was intensely
amused. She was extremely fetching in her bicorne
toque and narrow gown of light turquoise, and her
golden beaver scarf and muff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mischief,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I should say not. There
seems to be already sufficient mischief loose in the world,
with the red tide rising everywhere&ndash;&ndash;in Russia, in Germany,
Austria, Italy, England&ndash;&ndash;yes, and here also the
crimson tide of Bolshevism begins to move....
Tell me; you are coming to the club to-morrow evening,
I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he repeated, almost sullenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough
of queerness for a while&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim! Do you dare include me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had to laugh at her pretence of fury: &ldquo;No,
Marya, you&rsquo;re just a pretty mischief-maker, I suppose&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you mean by &lsquo;queerness&rsquo;? Don&rsquo;t
you think it&rsquo;s sensible to combat Bolshevism and fight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
it with argument and debate on its own selected camping
ground? Don&rsquo;t you think it is high time somebody
faced this crimson tide&ndash;&ndash;that somebody started to build
a dyke against this threatened inundation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best dykes have machine guns behind them, not
orators,&rdquo; he said bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, I have seen that, also. And to what
have machine guns led us in Petrograd, in Moscow, in
Poland, Finland, Courland&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She shrugged her
pretty shoulders. &ldquo;No. I have seen enough blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;I have seen a little myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But a soldier is always a soldier, as
a hound is always a hound. The blood of the quarry
is what their instinct follows. Your goal is death; we
only seek to tame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proper way to check Bolshevism in America is
to police the country properly, and kick out the outrageous
gang of domestic Bolsheviki who have exploited
us, tricked us, lied to us, taxed us unfairly, and in
spite of whom we have managed to help our allies win
this war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when this petty, wretched, crooked bunch
has been swept out, and the nation aired and disinfected,
and when the burden of taxation is properly
distributed, and business dares lift its head again, then
start your debates and propaganda and try to educate
your enemies if you like. But keep your machine guns
oiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak in an uncomplimentary fashion of government,&rdquo;
said the girl, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am all for government. That does not mean
that I am for the particular incumbents in office under
the present Government. I have no use for them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
Know that this war was won, not through them but in
spite of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I place loyalty first of all&ndash;&ndash;loyalty to the true
ideals of that Government which some of the present
incumbents so grotesquely misrepresent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means, stand by the ship and the flag she
flies, no matter who steers or what crew capers about
her decks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means, watch out for all pirates;&ndash;&ndash;open fire
on anything that flies a hostile flag, red or any other
colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s my creed, Marya!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To shoot; not to debate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An inquest is safer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall never agree,&rdquo; said the girl, laughing.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m rather glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because disagreements are more amusing than any
<i>entente cordiale</i>, <i>mon ami</i>. It is the opposing forces
that never bore each other. In life, too&ndash;&ndash;I mean among
human beings. Once they agree, interest lessens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is quite true. Behold us. We don&rsquo;t agree.
But I am interested,&rdquo; she added with pretty audacity;
&ldquo;so please take me to dinner somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean now, as we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parbleu! Did you wish to go home and dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;we dine where there is
something to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Broadway joint?&rdquo; he asked, amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A joint?&rdquo; she repeated, smilingly perplexed. &ldquo;Is
that a place where we may dine and see a spectacle
too and afterward dance?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Something of that sort,&rdquo; he admitted, laughing.
But under his careless gaiety an ugly determination
had been hardening; he meant to go no more to Palla;
he meant to welcome any distraction of the moment
to help tide him over the long, grey interval that loomed
ahead&ndash;&ndash;welcome any draught that might mitigate the
bitter waters he was tasting&ndash;&ndash;and was destined to drain
to their revolting dregs.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>They went to the Palace of Mirrors and were lucky
enough to secure a box.</p>
<p>The food was excellent; the show a gay one.</p>
<p>Between intermissions he took Marya to the floor
for a dance or two. The place was uncomfortably
crowded: uniforms were everywhere, too; and Jim
nodded to many men he knew, and to a few women.</p>
<p>And, in the vast, brilliant place, there was not a
man who saw Marya and failed to turn and follow her
with his eyes. For Marya had been fashioned to trouble
man. And that primitively constructed and obviously-minded
sex never failed to become troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better enjoy our champagne,&rdquo; remarked
Marya. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be a wineless nation before long, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems rather a pity,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that a man
shouldn&rsquo;t be free to enjoy a glass of claret. But if the
unbaked and the half-baked, and the unwashed and the
half-washed can&rsquo;t be trusted to practise moderation,
we others ought to abstain, I suppose. Because what
is best for the majority ought to be the law for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were left to me,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d let the
submerged drink themselves to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you talking about?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I thought you were a socialist!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am. I desire no law except that of individual
inclination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s Bolshevism!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her laughter rang out unrestrained: &ldquo;I believe in
Bolshevism&ndash;&ndash;for myself&ndash;&ndash;but not for anybody else. In
other words, I&rsquo;d like to be autocrat of the world. If
I were, I&rsquo;d let everybody alone unless they interfered
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in that event?&rdquo; he asked, laughing, as the
lights all over the house faded to a golden glimmer in
preparation for the second part of the spectacle. He
could no longer see her clearly across the little table.
&ldquo;What would you do if people interfered with you?&rdquo;
he repeated.</p>
<p>Marya smiled. The last ray of light smouldered in
her tiger-red hair; the warm, fragrant, breathing youth
of her grew vaguer, merging with the shadows; only
the beryl-tinted eyes, which slanted slightly, remained
distinct.</p>
<p>Her voice came to him through the music: &ldquo;If I
were autocrat, any man who dared oppose me would
have his choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What choice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The music swelled toward a breathless crescendo.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;Oppose me and you shall learn!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house burst into a dazzling flood of moon-tinted
light, all thronged with slim shapes whirling in an
enchanted dance. Then clouds seemed to gather; the
moon slid behind them, leaving a frosty demi-darkness
through which, presently, snow began to fall.</p>
<p>The girl leaned toward him, watching the spectacle
in silence. Perhaps unconsciously her left hand, satin-smooth,
slipped over his&ndash;&ndash;as though the contact were
a symbol of enjoyment shared.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>Light broke the next moment, revealing the spectacle
on stage and floor in all its tinsel magnificence&ndash;&ndash;snow-nymphs,
polar-bears, all capering madly until an unearthly
shriek heralded the coming of a favorite clown,
who tumbled all the way down the stage steps and continued
hysterically turning flip-flaps, cart-wheels, and
somersaults until he landed with a crash at the foot of
the steps again.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>A large, highly coloured and over-glossy man, passing
under their box during a dancing intermission, bowed
rather extravagantly to Jim. He recognised Angelo
Puma, with contemptuous amusement at his impudence.</p>
<p>It was evident, too, that Puma was quite ready to
linger if encouraged&ndash;&ndash;anxious, in fact, to extend his
hand.</p>
<p>But his impudence had already ceased to amuse Jim,
and he said carelessly to Marya, in a voice perfectly
audible to Puma:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes a man who, in collusion with a squinting
partner of his, once beat me out of a commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma&rsquo;s heavy, burning face turned abruptly from
Marya, whom he had been looking at; and he continued
on across the floor. And Jim forgot him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>They remained until the place closed. Then he took
her home.</p>
<p>It was an apartment overlooking the park from
Fifty-ninth Street&ndash;&ndash;a big studio and apparently many
comfortable rooms&ndash;&ndash;a large, still place where no servants
were in evidence and where thick velvety carpets
from Ushak and Sultanabad muffled every footfall.</p>
<p>She had insisted on his entering for a moment. He
stood looking about him in the great studio, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
Vanya&rsquo;s concert-grand loomed up, a sprawling, shadowy
shape under the dim drop-light which once had been
a mosque-lamp in Samarcand.</p>
<p>The girl flung stole and muff from her, rolled up
her gloves and took a shot at the piano, then, laughing,
unpinned her hat and sent it scaling away into
the golden dusk somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sleepy, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden vision of his trouble in the long, long night
to face&ndash;&ndash;trouble, insomnia, and the bitterness welling
ever fresher with the interminable thoughts he could
not suppress, could not control&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sleepy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you want to
turn in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went over to the piano, and, accompanying herself
on deadened pedal where she stood, sang in a low
voice the &ldquo;<i>Snow-Tiger</i>,&rdquo; with its uncanny refrain:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent12'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Tiger-eyes<br />

<span class='indent12'>&nbsp;</span>Over the snow.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too hilarious a song,&rdquo; said Jim, laughing.
&ldquo;May I suggest a little rag to properly subdue us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like <i>Tiger-eyes</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard more cheerful ditties.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m excited by pleasure,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I
sing <i>Tiger-eyes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it subdue you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still standing, she looked down at the keys, struck
the muffled chords softly.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent9'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Tiger-eyes<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for the love of Mike&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marya&rsquo;s laughter pealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t like <i>Tiger-eyes</i>?&rdquo; she demanded, coming
from behind the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real Russian name of the song is &lsquo;Words!
Words!&rsquo; And that&rsquo;s all the song is&ndash;&ndash;all that any song
is&ndash;&ndash;all that anything amounts to&ndash;&ndash;words! words!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
She dropped onto the long couch,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Anything except&ndash;&ndash;love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may include that, too,&rdquo; he said, lighting a
cigarette for her; and she blew a ring of smoke at
him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may&ndash;&ndash;but I won&rsquo;t. For goodness sake leave me
the last one of my delusions!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>They both laughed and he said she was welcome to
her remaining delusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you share it with me?&rdquo; she said, her smile
innocent enough, save for the audacity of the red mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Share your delusion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t do. He lighted a cigarette for himself
and sauntered over to the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Vanya&rsquo;s concert is a success,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
such a charming fellow, Vanya&ndash;&ndash;so considerate, so
gentle&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He turned and looked at Marya, and his
eyes added: &ldquo;Why the devil don&rsquo;t you marry him and
have a lot of jolly children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed to be in his clear eyes enough for the
girl to comprehend something of the question they
flung at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love Vanya,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I might love a child&ndash;&ndash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a silence: &ldquo;It strikes me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re
passionately in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With yourself,&rdquo; he added, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t do any longer. The place slightly
stifled him with its stillness, rugs&ndash;&ndash;the odours that came
from lacquered shapes, looming dimly, flowered and
golden in the dusk&ndash;&ndash;the aromatic scent of her cigarette&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;This is no
place for a white man.&rdquo; But aloud he said pleasantly:
&ldquo;My very best wishes for Vanya to-night. Tell him
so when he returns&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He put on his overcoat and
picked up hat and stick.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s infernally late,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been a
beast to keep you up. It was awfully nice of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from the lounge and walked with him to
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said cheerily; but she retained his
hand, added her other to it, and put up her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, smilingly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that,
Marya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her soft breath was on his face; the mouth too near&ndash;&ndash;too
near&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said curtly, but his voice trembled
a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s Vanya. No, I won&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love Vanya. I do love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please remember&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I have nothing to remember&ndash;&ndash;unless
you give me something&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better try to remember that Vanya loves
you. You and I can&rsquo;t do a thing like that to Vanya&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there no other reasons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reddened to the temples: &ldquo;No, there are not&ndash;&ndash;now.
There is no other reason&ndash;&ndash;except myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, damn it, myself! That&rsquo;s all that remains now
to keep me straight. And I&rsquo;ve been so. That may be
news to you. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so, Jim?&rdquo; she asked in a voice scarcely audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. And so I shall keep on, and play the
game that way&ndash;&ndash;play it squarely with Vanya, too&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>He had lost his heavy colour; he stood looking at her
with a white, strained, grim expression that tightened
the jaw muscles; and she felt his powerful hand clenching
between hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said between his set lips, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to go on&ndash;&ndash;see it through in my own fashion&ndash;&ndash;this
rotten thing called life. I&rsquo;m sorry, Marya, that
I&rsquo;m not a better sport&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wave of colour swept her face and her hands suddenly
crushed his between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the tense, grey look had come back into his
face. Looking at her in silence, presently his gaze
seemed to become remote, his absent eyes fixed on something
beyond her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a rotten time ahead of me,&rdquo; he said, not knowing
he had spoken. When his eyes reverted to her, his
features remained expressionless, but his voice was
almost tender as he said good night once more.</p>
<p>Her hands fell away; he opened the door and went
out without looking back.</p>
<p>He found a taxi at the Plaza. He was swearing
when he got into it. And all the way home he kept
repeating to himself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of those cursed, creeping
Josephs; that&rsquo;s what I am,&ndash;&ndash;one of those pepless, sanctimonious,
creeping Josephs.... And I always
loathed that poor fish, too!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Shotwell Junior discovered in due course
of time the memoranda of the repeated messages
which Palla had telephoned to his several clubs,
asking him to call her up immediately.</p>
<p>It was rather late to do that now, but his pulses
began to quicken again in the old, hopeless way; and
he went to the telephone booth and called the number
which seemed burnt into his brain forever.</p>
<p>A maid answered; Palla came presently; and he
thought her voice seemed colourless and unfamiliar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m perfectly well,&rdquo; she replied to his inquiry;
&ldquo;where in the world did you go that night? I simply
couldn&rsquo;t find you anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had you wished to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;except&ndash;&ndash;that I was afraid you were
angry when you left, and I didn&rsquo;t wish you to part
with me on such terms. Were you annoyed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it very curtly, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all you desired to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... I was a little troubled....
Something else went wrong, too;&ndash;&ndash;everything seemed
to go wrong that night.... I thought perhaps&ndash;&ndash;if
I could hear your voice&ndash;&ndash;if you&rsquo;d say something
kind&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you nothing else to tell me, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No.... What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t changed your attitude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward you? I don&rsquo;t expect to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. But, Jim, we can&rsquo;t discuss <i>that</i> over the telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not.... Is anything wrong with
you, Palla? Your voice sounds so tired&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it? I don&rsquo;t know why. Tell me, please, what
did you do that unhappy night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I telephoned your house about twelve, and was
informed you were not at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They thought I was asleep. I&rsquo;m sorry, Palla&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have telephoned so late,&rdquo; she interrupted,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that it was your mother who answered;
and if it was, I received the snub I deserved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! It wasn&rsquo;t meant that way&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it was, Jim. It&rsquo;s quite all right, though.
I won&rsquo;t do it again.... Am I to see you soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not for a while&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you so busy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in my going to you, Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m in love with you,&rdquo; he said bluntly,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m trying to get over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were <i>friends</i>, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a lengthy silence: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard his quick, deep breath like a sigh. &ldquo;Shall
I come to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting some people, Jim&ndash;&ndash;women who desire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
to establish a Combat Club in Chicago, and they have
come on here to consult me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow night, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he said: &ldquo;Palla, is anything worrying
you? Are you ill? Is Ilse all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, then Palla&rsquo;s voice, resolutely
tranquil. &ldquo;Everything is all right in the world as
long as you are kind to me, Jim. When you&rsquo;re not,
things darken and become queer&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! This is to serve notice on you. I&rsquo;m going
to make a fight for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a silence, he heard her sweet, uncertain laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would shock you if I made a fight for&ndash;&ndash;<i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took it as a jest and laughed at her perverse
humour. But what she had meant she herself scarcely
realised; and she turned away from the telephone, conscious
of a vague excitement invading her and of a
vaguer consternation, too. For behind the humorous
audacity of her words, she seemed to realise there remained
something hidden&ndash;&ndash;something she was on the
verge of discovering&ndash;&ndash;something indefinable, menacing,
grave enough to dismay her and drive from her lips
the last traces of the smile which her audacious jest
had left there.</p>
<p>The ladies from Chicago were to dine with her; her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
maid had hooked her gown; orchids from Jim had just
arrived, and she was still pinning them to her waist&ndash;&ndash;still
happily thrilled by this lovely symbol of their
renewed accord, when the bell rang.</p>
<p>It was much too early to expect anybody: she fastened
her orchids and started to descend the stairs for
a last glance at the table, when, to her astonishment,
she saw Angelo Puma in the hall in the act of depositing
his card upon the salver extended by the maid.</p>
<p>He looked up and saw her before she could retreat:
she made the best of it and continued on down, greeting
him with inquiring amiability:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dumont, a thousand excuses for this so bold
intrusion,&rdquo; he began, bowing extravagantly at every
word. &ldquo;Only the urgent importance of my errand
could possibly atone for a presumption like there never
has been in all&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please step into the drawing room, Mr. Puma, if
you have something of importance to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed her on tiptoe, flashing his magnificent
eyes about the place, still wearing over his evening
dress the seal overcoat with its gardenia, which was
already making him famous on Broadway.</p>
<p>Palla seated herself, wondering a little at the perfumed
splendour of her landlord. He sat on the extreme
edge of an arm chair, his glossy hat on his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dumont,&rdquo; he said, laying one white-gloved
paw across his shirt-front, &ldquo;you shall behold in me a
desolate man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; She looked at him in utter perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall you say to me?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What just
reproaches shall you address to me, Miss Dumont!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Puma,&rdquo; she said, inclined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
to laugh, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;until you tell me what is your
errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dumont, I am most unhappy and embarrass.
Because you have pay me in advance for that which I
am unable to offer you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! You have pay to me by cheque for six months
more rent of my hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given to you a lease for six months more,
and with it an option for a year of renewal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dumont, behold me desolate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am force by circumstance over which I
have no control to cancel this lease and option, and
ask you most respectfully to be so kind as to secure
other quarters for your club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; exclaimed Palla in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so very sorry&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; added Palla with decision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
utterly impossible, Mr. Puma. All our meetings are
arranged for months in advance; all the details are
completed. We could not disarrange the programme
adopted. From all over the United States people are
invited to come on certain fixed dates. All arrangements
have been made; you have my cheque and I have
your signed lease. No, we are obliged to hold you to
your contract, and I&rsquo;m very sorry if it inconveniences
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma&rsquo;s brilliant eyes became tenderly apprehensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dumont,&rdquo; he said in a hushed and confidential
voice, &ldquo;believe me when I venture to say to you that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
your club should leave for reasons most grave, most
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reasons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others&ndash;&ndash;the Red Flag Club. Who knows what
such crazy people might do in anger? They are very
angry already. They complain that your club has
interfere with them&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly why we&rsquo;re there, Mr. Puma&ndash;&ndash;to
interfere with them, neutralise their propaganda, try
to draw the same people who listen to their violent
tirades. That is why we&rsquo;re there, and why we refuse
to leave. Ours is a crusade of education. We chose
that hall because we desired to make the fight in the
very camp of the enemy. And I must tell you plainly
that we shall not give up our lease, and that we shall
hold you to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark blood flooded his heavy features:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not desire to take it to the courts,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I am willing to offer compensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t accept. Don&rsquo;t you understand, Mr.
Puma? We simply must have that particular hall for
the Combat Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma remained perfectly silent for a few moments.
There was still, on his thick lips, the suave smile which
had been stamped there since his appearance in her
house.</p>
<p>But in this man&rsquo;s mind and heart there was growing
a sort of dull and ferocious fear&ndash;&ndash;fear of elements
already gathering and combining to menace his increasing
prosperity.</p>
<p>Sullenly he was aware that this hard-won prosperity
was threatened. Always its conditions had been unstable
at best, but now the atmospheric pressure was
slowly growing, and his sky of promise was not as clear.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>Some way, somehow, he must manage to evict these
women. Twice Sondheim had warned him. And that
evening Sondheim had sent him an ultimatum by
Kastner.</p>
<p>And Puma was perfectly aware that Karl Kastner
knew enough about him to utterly ruin him in the great
Republic which was now giving him a fortune and
which had never discovered that his own treacherous
mission here was the accomplishment of her ruin.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Puma stood up, heavily, cradling his glossy hat.
But his urbane smile became brilliant again and he
made Palla an extravagant bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be arrange,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;I consult
my partner&ndash;&ndash;your <i>friend</i>, Mr. Skidder! Yes! So
shall we arrive at entente.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His large womanish eyes swept the room. Suddenly
they were arrested by a photograph of Shotwell Junior&ndash;&ndash;in
a silver frame&ndash;&ndash;the only ornament, as yet, in the
little drawing room.</p>
<p>And instantly, within Angelo Puma, the venomous
instinct was aroused to do injury where it might be
done safely and without suspicion of intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he exclaimed gaily, &ldquo;my friend, Mr. Shotwell!
It is from him, Miss Dumont, you have purchase
this so beautiful residence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent to salute with a fanciful inclination the
photograph of the man who had spoken so contemptuously
of him the evening previous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Shotwell also adores gaiety,&rdquo; he said laughingly.
&ldquo;Last night I beheld him at the Palace of
Mirrors&ndash;&ndash;and with an attractive young lady of your
club, Miss Dumont&ndash;&ndash;the charming young Russian lady
with whom you came once to pay me the rent&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
kissed his hand in an ecstasy of recollection. &ldquo;So
beautiful a young lady! So gay were they in their
box! Ah, youth! youth! Ah, the happiness and folly
when laughter bubbles in our wine!&ndash;&ndash;the magic wine of
youth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took his leave, moving lightly to the door, almost
grotesque in his elaborate evolutions and adieux.</p>
<p>Palla went slowly upstairs.</p>
<p>The evening paper lay on a table in the living room.
She unfolded it mechanically; looked at it but saw no
print, merely an unsteady haze of greyish tint on
which she could not seem to concentrate.</p>
<p>Marya and Jim ... together.... That
was the night he went away angry.... The
night he told her he had gone directly home....
But it couldn&rsquo;t have been.... He couldn&rsquo;t have
lied....</p>
<p>She strove to recollect as she sat there staring at the
newspaper.... What was it that beast had said
about it?... Of course&ndash;&ndash;<i>last</i> night!...
Marya and Jim had been together last night....
But where was Vanya?... Oh, yes....
Last night Vanya was away ... in Baltimore.</p>
<p>The paper dropped to her lap; she sat looking
straight ahead of her.</p>
<p>What had so shocked her then about Jim and Marya
being together? True, she had not supposed them to
be on such terms&ndash;&ndash;had not even thought about it....</p>
<p>Yes, she <i>had</i> thought about it, scarcely conscious
of her own indefinable uneasiness&ndash;&ndash;a memory, perhaps,
of that evening when the Russian girl had been at little
pains to disguise her interest in this man. And Palla
had noticed it&ndash;&ndash;noticed that Marya was seated too
near him&ndash;&ndash;noticed that, and the subtle attitude of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
provocation, and the stealthy evolution of that occult
sorcery which one woman instantly divines in another
and finds slightly revolting.</p>
<p>Was it merely that memory which had been evoked
when Puma&rsquo;s laughing revelation so oddly chilled her?&ndash;&ndash;the
suspected and discovered predilection of this
Russian girl for Jim? Or was it something else, something
deeper, some sudden and more profound illumination
which revealed to her that, in the depths of her,
she was afraid?</p>
<p>Afraid? Afraid of what?</p>
<p>Her charming young head sank; the brown eyes
stared at the floor.</p>
<p>She was beginning to understand what had chilled
her, what she had unconsciously been afraid of&ndash;&ndash;<i>her
own creed!</i>&ndash;&ndash;when applied to another woman.</p>
<p>And this was the second time that this creed of hers
had risen to confront her, and the second time she had
gazed at it, chilled by fear: once, when she had waited
for Ilse to return; and now once again.</p>
<p>For now she began to comprehend how ruthless that
creed could become when professed by such a girl as
Marya Lanois.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She was still seated there when Marya came in, her
tiger-red hair in fascinating disorder from the wind,
her skin fairly breathing the warm fragrance of exotic
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Palla! How pale you seem!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
embracing her. &ldquo;You are quite well? Really? Then
I am reassured!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to the mirror and tucked in a burnished
strand or two of hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Chicago ladies&ndash;&ndash;they have not arrived, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
see. Am I then so early? For I see that Ilse is not
yet here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a quarter to eight,&rdquo; said Palla, smiling;
but the brown eyes were calmly measuring this lithe and
warm and lovely thing with green eyes&ndash;&ndash;measuring it
intently&ndash;&ndash;taking its measure&ndash;&ndash;taking, for the first
time in her life, her measure of any woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Vanya&rsquo;s concert a great success?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanya has not yet returned.&rdquo; She shrugged.
&ldquo;There was nothing in New York papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you were very nervous last night,&rdquo; said
Palla.</p>
<p>For a moment Marya continued to arrange her hair
by the aid of the mantel mirror, then she turned very
lithely and let her green gaze rest full on Palla&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>What she might possibly have divined was hidden
behind the steady brown eyes that met hers may have
determined her attitude and words; for she laughed
with frank carelessness and plunged into it all:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy, Palla, my encountering Jim Shotwell in the
Biltmore, and dining with him at that noisy Palace of
Mirrors last night! Did he tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;Over the telephone, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he did not mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was most amusing. It is the unpremeditated
that is delightful. And can you see us in that
dreadful place, as gay as a pair of school children?
And we must laugh at nothing and find it enchanting&ndash;&ndash;and
we must dance amid the hoi polloi and clap our
hands for the encore too!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light peal of laughter floated from her lips at the
recollections evoked:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And after! Can you see us, Palla, in Vanya&rsquo;s
studio, too wide awake to go our ways!&ndash;&ndash;and the song
I sang at that unearthly hour&ndash;&ndash;the song I sing always
when happily excited&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell rang; the first guest had arrived.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p>Vanya&rsquo;s concert had been enough of a success to
attract the attention of genuine music-lovers
and an impecunious impresario&ndash;&ndash;an irresponsible
promoter celebrated for rushing headlong into
things and being kicked headlong out of them.</p>
<p>All promising virtuosi had cut their wisdom teeth
on him; all had acquired experience and its accompanying
toothache; none had acquired wealth until free of
this ubiquitous impresario.</p>
<p>His name was Wilding: he seized upon Vanya; and
that gentle and disconcerted dreamer offered no resistance.</p>
<p>So Wilding began to haunt Vanya&rsquo;s apartment at
all hours of the day, rushing in with characteristic
enthusiasm to discuss the vast campaign of nation-wide
concerts which in his mind&rsquo;s eye were already
materialising.</p>
<p>Marya had no faith in him and was becoming very
tired of his noise and bustle in the stillness and subdued
light which meant home to her, and which this
loud, excitable, untidy man was eternally invading.</p>
<p>Always he was shouting at Vanya: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a knock-out!
It will go big! big! big! We got &rsquo;em started in Baltimore!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;a
fact, but none of his doing! &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll play
Philadelphia next; I&rsquo;m fixin&rsquo; it for you. All you gotta
do is go there and the yelling starts. Well, I guess.
Some riot, believe <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilding had no money in the beginning. After a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
while, Vanya had none, or very little; but the impresario
wore a new fur coat and spats. And Broadway
winked wearily and said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got another!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;doubtless
deeming specification mere redundancy.</p>
<p>Yet, somehow, Wilding did manage to book Vanya
in Philadelphia&ndash;&ndash;at a somewhat distant date, it is true&ndash;&ndash;but
it was something with which to begin the promised
&ldquo;nation-wide tour&rdquo; under the auspices of Dawson
B. Wilding.</p>
<p>Marya had money of her own, but trusted none of
it in Wilding&rsquo;s schemes. In fact, she had come to detest
him thoroughly, and whenever he was announced she
would rise like some beautiful, disgusted feline, which
something has disturbed in her dim and favourite corner,
and move lithely away to another room. And it
almost seemed as though her little, warm, closely-chiselled
ears actually flattened with bored annoyance as
the din of Wilding&rsquo;s vociferous greeting to Vanya arose
behind her.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>One day toward Christmas time, she said to Vanya, in
her level, satin-smooth voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, <i>mon ami</i>, I am tiring rapidly of this
great fool who comes shouting and tramping into our
home. And when I am annoyed beyond my nerve
capacity, I am likely to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vanya said gently that he was sorry that he had
entered into financial relations with a man who annoyed
her, but that it could scarcely be helped now.</p>
<p>He was seated at his piano, not playing, but scoring.
And he resumed his composition after he had spoken,
his grave, delicate head bent over the ruled sheets, a
gold pencil held between his long fingers.</p>
<p>Marya lounged near, watched him. Not for the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
time, now, did his sweet temper and gentleness vaguely
irritate her&ndash;&ndash;string her nerves a little tighter until
they began to vibrate with an indefinable longing to
say something to arouse this man&ndash;&ndash;startle him&ndash;&ndash;awaken
him to a physical tensity and strength.... Such
as Shotwell&rsquo;s for example....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanya?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up absently, the beauty of dreams still
clouding his eyes.</p>
<p>And suddenly, to her own astonishment, her endurance
came to its end. She had never expected to say
what she was now going to say to him. She had never
dreamed of confession&ndash;&ndash;of enlightening him. And now,
all at once, she knew she was going to do it, and that
it was a needless and cruel and insane and useless thing
to do, for it led her nowhere, and it would leave him
in helpless pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanya,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am in love with Jim Shotwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few moments, she turned and slowly crossed
the studio. Her hat and coat lay on a chair. She
put them on and walked out.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The following morning, Palla, arriving to consult
Marya on a matter of the Club&rsquo;s business, discovered
Vanya alone in the studio.</p>
<p>He was lying on the lounge when she entered, and he
looked ill, but he rose with all his characteristic grace
and charm and led her to a chair, saluting her hand as
he seated her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marya has not yet arrived?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>His delicate features became very grave and still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; added Palla, &ldquo;that Marya usually
breakfasted at eleven&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in his expression checked her; and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
fell silent, fascinated by the deathly whiteness of his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to tell you,&rdquo; he said, in a pleasant and
steady voice, &ldquo;that Marya has not returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;why, I didn&rsquo;t know she was away&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday she decided. Later she was good enough
to telephone from the Hotel Rajah, where, for the
present, she expects to remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Vanya!&rdquo; Palla&rsquo;s involuntary exclamation
brought a trace of colour into his cheeks.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;It is not her fault. She was loyal and
truthful. One may not control one&rsquo;s heart....
And if she is in love&ndash;&ndash;well, is she not free to love him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;it?&rdquo; asked Palla faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Shotwell, it appears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dead silence, Vanya passed his hand slowly
across his temples; let it drop on his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freedom above all else,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;freedom to
love, freedom to cease loving, freedom to love anew....
Well ... it is curious&ndash;&ndash;the scheme of
things.... Love must remain inexplicable. For
there is no analysis. I think there never could be any
man who cared as I have cared, as I do care for
her....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose, and to Palla he seemed already a trifle
stooped;&ndash;&ndash;it may have been his studio coat, which
fitted badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Vanya dear&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Palla looked at him miserably,
conscious of her own keen fears as well as of his sorrow.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;ll come back? Do you suppose
it is really so serious&ndash;&ndash;what she thinks about&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
Shotwell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.... If it is
so, it is so. Freedom is of first importance. Our creed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
is our creed. We must abide by what we teach and
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded absently, staring palely into space.</p>
<p>Perhaps his lost gaze evoked the warm-skinned,
sunny-haired girl who had gone out of the semi-light of
this still place, leaving the void unutterably vast around
him. For this had been the lithe thing&rsquo;s silken lair&ndash;&ndash;the
slim and supple thing with beryl eyes&ndash;&ndash;here where
thick-piled carpets of the East deadened every human
movement&ndash;&ndash;where no sound stirred, nor any air&ndash;&ndash;where
dull shapes loomed, lacquered and indistinct, and an
odour of Chinese lacquer and nard haunted the tinted
dusk.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Like one of those lazy, golden, jewelled sea-creatures
of irresponsible freedom brought seemed to fill the girl
cooler currents arouses a restlessness infernal, Marya&rsquo;s
first long breath of freedom subtly excited her.</p>
<p>She had no definite ideas, no plans. She was merely
tired of Vanya.</p>
<p>Perhaps her fresh, wholesome contact with Jim had
started it&ndash;&ndash;the sense of a clean vitality which had seemed
to envelop her like the delicious, half-resented chill
of a spring-pool plunge. For the exhilaration possessed
her still; and the sudden stimulation which the sense
of irresponsible freedom brought seemed to fill the girl
with a new vigour.</p>
<p>Foot-loose, heart-loose, her green eyes on the open
world where it stretched away into infinite horizons,
she paced her new nest in the Hotel Rajah, tingling
with subdued excitement, innocent of the faintest regret
for what had been.</p>
<p>For a week she lived alone, enjoying the sensation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
of being hidden, languidly savouring the warm
comfort of isolation.</p>
<p>She had not sent for her belongings. She purchased
new personal effects, enchanted to be rid of familiar
things.</p>
<p>There was no snow. She walked a great deal, moving
in unaccustomed sections of the city at all hours, skirting
in the early winter dusk the glitter of Christmas
preparations along avenues and squares, lunching where
she was unlikely to encounter anybody she knew, dining,
too, at hazard in unwonted places&ndash;&ndash;restaurants she
had never heard of, tea-rooms, odd corners.</p>
<p>Vanya wrote her. She tossed his letters aside,
scarcely read. Ilse and Palla wrote her, and telephoned
her. She paid them no attention.</p>
<p>The metropolitan jungle fascinated her. She adored
her liberty, and looked out of beryl-green eyes across
the border of license, where ghosts of the half-world
swarmed in no-man&rsquo;s-land.</p>
<p>Conscious that she had been fashioned to trouble
man, the knowledge merely left her indefinitely contented,
save when she remembered Jim. But that he
had checked her drift toward him merely excited her;
for she knew she had been made to trouble such as he;
and she had seen his face that night....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Ilse, on her way home to dress&ndash;&ndash;for she was going
out somewhere with Estridge&ndash;&ndash;stopped for tea at Palla&rsquo;s
house, and found her a little disturbed over an anonymous
letter just delivered&ndash;&ndash;a typewritten sheet bluntly
telling her to take her friends and get out of the hall
where the Combat Club held its public sessions; and
warning her of serious trouble if she did not heed this
&ldquo;friendly&rdquo; advice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Pouf!&rdquo; exclaimed Ilse contemptuously, &ldquo;I get those,
too, and tear them up. People who talk never strike.
Are you anxious, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla smiled: &ldquo;Not a bit&ndash;&ndash;only such cowardice saddens
me.... And the days are grey enough....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that? I think it is a wonderful
winter&ndash;&ndash;a beautiful year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla lifted her brown eyes and let them dwell on
the beauty of this clear-skinned, golden-haired girl who
had discovered beauty in the aftermath of the world&rsquo;s
great tragedy.</p>
<p>Ilse smiled: &ldquo;Life is good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This world
is all to be done over in the right way. We have it
all before us, you and I, Palla, and those who love
and understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am wondering,&rdquo; said Palla, &ldquo;who understands us.
I&rsquo;m not discouraged, but&ndash;&ndash;there seems to be so much
indifference in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. That is our battle to overcome it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But, dear, there seems to be so much hatred,
too, in the world. I thought the war had ended, but
everywhere men are still in battle&ndash;&ndash;everywhere men
are dying of this fierce hatred that seems to flame up
anew across the world; everywhere men fight and slay
to gain advantage. None yields, none renounces, none
gives. It is as though love were dead on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is being reborn,&rdquo; said Ilse cheerfully. &ldquo;Birth
means pain, always&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without warning, a hot flush flooded her face; she
averted it as the tea-tray was brought and set on a
table before Palla. When her face cooled, she leaned
back in her chair, cup in hand, a sort of confused
sweetness in her blue eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s heart was beating heavily as she leaned on
the table, her cup untasted, her idle fingers crumbing
the morsel of biscuit between them.</p>
<p>After a moment she said: &ldquo;So you have concluded
that you care for John Estridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I care,&rdquo; said Ilse absently, the same odd, sweet
smile curving her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is&ndash;&ndash;wonderful,&rdquo; said Palla, not looking at
her.</p>
<p>Ilse remained silent, her blue gaze aloof.</p>
<p>A maid came and turned up the lamps, and went
away again.</p>
<p>Palla said in a low voice: &ldquo;Are you&ndash;&ndash;afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both remained silent until she rose to go. Palla,
walking with her to the head of the stairs, holding one
of her hands imprisoned, said with an effort: &ldquo;I am
frightened, dear.... I can&rsquo;t help it....
You will be certain, first, won&rsquo;t you?&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as certain as death,&rdquo; said Ilse in a low, still
voice.</p>
<p>Palla shivered; she passed one arm around her; and
they stood so for a while. Then Ilse&rsquo;s arm tightened,
and the old gaiety glinted in her sea-blue eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your house in order too, Palla?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Turn around, little enigma! There; I can look into
those brown eyes now. And I see nothing in them to
answer me my question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weeks. I don&rsquo;t know how long it has been&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you quarrelled?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We seem to. This is quite the most serious
one yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ilse, I don&rsquo;t know. He simply can&rsquo;t understand
me. I feel so bruised and tired after a controversy
with him. He seems to be so merciless to my opinions&ndash;&ndash;so
violent&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child.... After all, Palla, freedom
also means the liberty to change one&rsquo;s mind....
If you should care to change yours&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t change my inmost convictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those&ndash;&ndash;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not changed them. I almost wish I could.
But I&rsquo;ve got to be honest.... And he can&rsquo;t understand
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse smiled and kissed her: &ldquo;That is scarcely to be
wondered at, as you don&rsquo;t seem to know your own mind.
Perhaps when you do he, also, may understand you.
Good-bye! I must run&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla watched her to the foot of the stairs; the door
closed; the engine of a taxi began to hum.</p>
<p>Her telephone was ringing when she returned to the
living room, and the quick leap of her heart averted
her of the hope revived.</p>
<p>But it was a strange voice on the wire,&ndash;&ndash;a man&rsquo;s
voice, clear, sinister, tainted with a German accent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iss this Miss Dumont? Yess? Then this I haff
to say to you: You shall find yourself in serious
trouble if you do not move your foolish club of vimmen
out of the vicinity of which you know. We giff you
one more chance. So shall you take it or you shall
take some consequences! <i>Goot-night!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The instrument clicked in her ear as the unknown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
threatener hung up, leaving her seated there, astonished,
hurt, bewildered.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The man who &ldquo;hung up on her&rdquo; stepped out of a
saloon on Eighth Avenue and joined two other men
on the corner.</p>
<p>The man was Karl Kastner; the other two were
Sondheim and Bromberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get her?&rdquo; growled the latter, as all three started
east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yess. And now we shall see what we shall see.
We start the finish now already. All foolishness shall
be ended. Now we fix Puma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued on across the street, clumping along
with their overcoat collars turned up, for it had turned
bitter cold and the wind was rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a plant?&rdquo; inquired Sondheim,
for the third time.</p>
<p>Bromberg blew his red nose on a dirty red handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll plant Puma if he tries any of that,&rdquo; he said
thickly.</p>
<p>Kastner added that he feared investigation more
than they did because he had more at stake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot guy he iss rich like a millionaire,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;Ve make him pay some dammach, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s he going to fire that bunch of women if they
got a lease?&rdquo; demanded Bromberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the hell cares how he does it?&rdquo; grunted Sondheim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; added Kastner; &ldquo;let him dig up. You buy
anybody if you haff sufficient coin. Effery time! Yess.
Also! Let him dig down into his pants once. So shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
he pay them, these vimmen, to go avay und shut up
mit their mischief what they make for us already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sondheim was still muttering about &ldquo;plants&rdquo; in the
depths of his soiled overcoat-collar, when they arrived
at the hall and presented themselves at the door of
Puma&rsquo;s outer office.</p>
<p>A girl took their message. After a while she returned
and piloted them out, and up a wide flight of stairs
to a door marked, &ldquo;No admittance.&rdquo; Here she knocked,
and Puma&rsquo;s voice bade them enter.</p>
<p>Angelo Puma was standing by a desk when they
trooped in, keeping their hats on. The room was
ventilated and illumined in the daytime only by a very
dirty transom giving on a shaft. Otherwise, there
were no windows, no outlet to any outer light and air.</p>
<p>Two gas jets caged in wire&ndash;&ndash;obsolete stage dressing-room
effects&ndash;&ndash;lighted the room and glimmered on
Puma&rsquo;s polished top-hat and the gold knob of his walking-stick.</p>
<p>As for Puma himself, he glanced up stealthily from
the scenario he was reading as he stood by the big
desk, but dropped his eyes again, and, opening a
drawer, laid away the typed manuscript. Then he
pulled out the revolving desk chair and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he inquired, lighting a cigar.</p>
<p>There was an ominous silence among the three men
for another moment. Then Puma looked up, puffing
his cigar, and Sondheim stepped forward from the
group and shook his finger in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What yah got planted around here for us? Hey?&rdquo;
he demanded in a low, hoarse voice. &ldquo;Come on now,
Puma! What yeh think yeh got on us?&rdquo; And to
Kastner and Bromberg: &ldquo;Go ahead, boys, look for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
dictaphone and them kind of things. And if this wop
hollers I&rsquo;ll do him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ruddy light flickered in Puma&rsquo;s eyes, but the cool
smile lay smoothly on his lips, and he did not even turn
his head to watch them as they passed along the walls,
sounding, peering, prying, and jerking open the door
of the cupboard&ndash;&ndash;the only furniture there except the
desk and the chair on which Puma sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s the matter with yeh?&rdquo; snarled
Sondheim, suddenly stooping to catch Puma&rsquo;s eye,
which had wandered as though bored by the proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Puma, coolly; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter
with you, Max?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kastner came around beside him and said in his
thin, sinister tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it vat I got on you, Angelo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Also! Vas iss it you do about doze vimmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Bromberg&rsquo;s voice sounded an ominous roar:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hand us nothing like that! You hear what
I&rsquo;m telling you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma shrugged: &ldquo;I hand you what I have to hand
you. They have the lease. What is there for me
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy &rsquo;em off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try. They will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You offer &rsquo;em enough and they&rsquo;ll quit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They will not. They say they are here to
fight you. They laugh at my money. What shall
I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing you&rsquo;ll do, and do it damn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
quick!&rdquo; roared Bromberg. &ldquo;Hand over that money
we need!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you bellow in so loud a manner,&rdquo; said Puma,
&ldquo;they could hear you in the studio.... How
much do you ask for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What yeh mean by &lsquo;No&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I say to you, that I have not two thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lying greaser&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not lie. I have paid my people and there remains
but six hundred dollars in my bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we get the rest?&rdquo; asked Sondheim, as Puma
tossed the packet of bills onto the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I make it,&rdquo; replied Puma tranquilly. &ldquo;You
will understand my receipts are my capital at present.
What else I have is engaged already in my new theatre.
If you will be patient you shall have what I can spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bromberg rested both hairy fists on the desk and
glared down at Puma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this new guy you got to go in with you?
What&rsquo;s the matter with our getting a jag of his coin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Mr. Pawling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh. Who the hell is that duck what inks his
whiskers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let him shove us ours then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to ruin me?&rdquo; inquired Puma placidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while you&rsquo;re milkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Sondheim, showing
every yellow fang in a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do not frighten Mr. Pawling out. Already
you have scared my other partner, Mr. Skidder, like
there never was any rabbits scared. You are foolish.
If you are reasonable, I shall make money and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
shall have your share. If you are not, then there is
no money to give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sondheim said: &ldquo;Take a slant at them yellow-backs,
Karl.&rdquo; And Kastner screwed a powerful jeweller&rsquo;s
glass into his eye and began a minute examination of
the orange-coloured treasury notes, to find out whether
they were marked bills.</p>
<p>Bromberg said heavily: &ldquo;See here, Angelo, you gotta
quit this damned stalling! You gotta get them women
out, and do it quick or we&rsquo;ll blow your dirty barracks
into the North River!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sondheim began to wag his soiled forefinger again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh quit us cold when things was on the fritz.
Now, yeh gotta pay. If you wasn&rsquo;t nothing but a wop
skunk yeh&rsquo;d stand in with us. The way you&rsquo;re fixed
would help us all. But now yeh makin&rsquo; money and yeh
scared o&rsquo; yeh shadow!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bromberg cut in: &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be outside when the
band starts playing. Look what&rsquo;s doing all over the
world! Every country is starting something! You
watch Berlin and Rosa Luxemburg and her bunch.
Keep your eye peeled, Angy, and see what we and the
I. W. W. start in every city of the country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kastner, having satisfied himself that the bills had
not been marked, and pocketed his jeweller&rsquo;s glass,
pushed back his lank blond hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yess,&rdquo; he said in his icy, incisive voice, &ldquo;yoost vatch
out already! Dot crimson tide it iss rising the vorld all
ofer! It shall drown effery aristocrat, effery bourgeois,
effery intellectual. It shall be but a red flood ofer all
the vorld vere noddings shall live only our peoble off the
proletariat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where the hell will you be then, Angelo?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
sneered Bromberg. &ldquo;By God, we won&rsquo;t have to ask you
for our share of your money then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Sondheim leaned over him and wagged his
nicotine-dyed finger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get the rest of our money! Understand? And
you get them women out!&ndash;&ndash;or I tell you we&rsquo;ll blow you
and your joint to Hoboken! Get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have understood,&rdquo; said Puma quietly; but his
heavy face was a muddy red now, and he choked a
little when he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a date and stick to it,&rdquo; added Bromberg.
&ldquo;Set it yourself. And after that we won&rsquo;t bother to
do any more jawin&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ll just attend to business&ndash;&ndash;<i>your</i>
business, Puma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long silence, Puma said calmly: &ldquo;How much
you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand,&rdquo; said Sondheim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And them women out of this,&rdquo; added Bromberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or ve get you,&rdquo; ended Kastner in his deadly voice.</p>
<p>Puma lifted his head and looked intently at each
one of them in turn. And seemed presently to come to
some conclusion.</p>
<p>Kastner forestalled him: &ldquo;You try it some monkey
trick and you try it no more effer again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your date for the cash?&rdquo; insisted Sondheim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;February first,&rdquo; replied Puma quietly.</p>
<p>Kastner wrote it on the back of an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Und dese vimmen?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a lawyer&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hell with that stuff!&rdquo; roared Bromberg. &ldquo;Get
&rsquo;em out! Scare &rsquo;em out! Jesus Christ! how long
d&rsquo;yeh think we&rsquo;re going to stand for being hammered
by that bunch o&rsquo; skirts? They got a lot o&rsquo; people
sore on us now. The crowd what uster come around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
is gettin&rsquo; leery. And who are these damned women?
One of &rsquo;em was a White Nun, when they did the business
for the Romanoffs. One of &rsquo;em fired on the
Bolsheviki&ndash;&ndash;that big blond girl with yellow hair, I mean!
Wasn&rsquo;t she one of those damned girl-soldiers? And
look what she&rsquo;s up to now&ndash;&ndash;comin&rsquo; over here to talk
us off the platform!&ndash;&ndash;the dirty foreigner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Bromberg, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s that redheaded
wench of Vanya&rsquo;s!&ndash;&ndash;some Grand Duke&rsquo;s slut,
they say, before she quit him for the university to start
something else&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kastner cut in in his steely voice: &ldquo;If you do not
throw out these women, Puma, we fix them and your
hall and you&ndash;&ndash;all at one time, my friend. Also! Iss
it then for February the first, our understanding? Or
iss it, a little later, the end of all your troubles,
Angelo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma got up, nodded his acceptance of their ultimatum,
and opened the door for them.</p>
<p>When they trooped out, under the brick arch, they
noticed his splendid limousine waiting, and as they
shuffled sullenly away westward, Bromberg, looking
back, saw Puma come out and jump lightly into the
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swine!&rdquo; he snarled, facing the bitter wind once more
and shuffling along beside his silent brethren.</p>
<p>Puma went east, then north to the Hotel Rajah,
where, in a private room, he was to complete a financial
transaction with Alonzo B. Pawling.</p>
<p>Skidder, too, came in at the same time, squinting
rapidly at his partner; and together they moved toward
the elevator.</p>
<p>The elevator waited a moment more to accommodate
a willowy, red-haired girl in furs, whose jade eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
barely rested on Puma&rsquo;s magnificent black ones as he
stepped aside to make way for her with an extravagant
bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some skirt,&rdquo; murmured Skidder in his ear, as the
car shot upward.</p>
<p>Marya left the car at the mezzanine floor: Puma&rsquo;s
eyes were like coals for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that dame?&rdquo; inquired Skidder, his eyes
fairly snapping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He did not add that he had seen her at the
Combat Club and knew her to belong to another man.
But his black eyes were almost blazing as he stepped
from the elevator, for in Marya&rsquo;s insolent glance he
had caught a vague glimmer of fire&ndash;&ndash;merely a green
spark, very faint&ndash;&ndash;if, indeed, it had been there at
all....</p>
<p>Pawling himself opened the door for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it all right? Do we get the parcel?&rdquo; were his
first words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a knock-out!&rdquo; cried Skidder, slapping him on
the back. &ldquo;We got the land, we got the plans, we got
the iron, we got the contracts!&ndash;&ndash;Oh, boy!&ndash;&ndash;our dough
is in&ndash;&ndash;go look at it and smell it for yourself! So get
into the jack, old scout, and ante up, because we break
ground Wednesday and there&rsquo;ll be bills before then,
you betcha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the cocktails were brought, Puma swallowed
his in a hurry, saying he&rsquo;d be back in a moment, and
bidding Skidder enlighten Mr. Pawling during the
interim.</p>
<p>He summoned the elevator, got out at the mezzanine,
and walked lightly into the deserted and cloister-like
perspective, his shiny hat in his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>And saw Marya standing by the marble ramp, looking
down at the bustle below.</p>
<p>He stopped not far away. He had made no sound
on the velvet carpet. But presently she turned her
head and the green eyes met his black ones.</p>
<p>Neither winced. The sheer bulk of the beast and the
florid magnificence of its colour seemed to fascinate her.</p>
<p>She had seen him before, and scarcely noted him.
She remembered. But the world was duller, then, and
the outlook grey. And then, too, her still, green eyes
had not yet wandered beyond far horizons, nor had her
heart been cut adrift to follow her fancy when the tides
stirred it from its mooring&ndash;&ndash;carrying it away, away
through deeps or shallows as the currents swerved.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p>The pale parody on that sacred date which once
had symbolised the birth of Christ had come
and gone; the ghastly year was nearing its
own death&ndash;&ndash;the bloodiest year, for all its final triumph,
that the world had ever witnessed&ndash;&ndash;<i>l&rsquo;ann&eacute;e horrible</i>!</p>
<p>Nor was the end yet, of all this death and dying:
for the Crimson Tide, washing through Russia, eastward,
seethed and eddied among the wrecks of empires,
lapping Poland&rsquo;s bones, splashing over the charred
threshold of the huns, creeping into the Balkans, crawling
toward Greece and Italy, menacing Scandinavia,
and arousing the stern watchers along the French
frontier&ndash;&ndash;the ultimate eastward barrier of human
liberty.</p>
<p>And unless, despite the fools who demur, that barrier
be based upon the Rhine, that barrier will fall one day.</p>
<p>Even in England, where the captive navies of the
anti-Christ now sulked at anchor under England&rsquo;s consecrated
guns, some talked glibly of rule by Soviet.
All Ireland bristled now, baring its teeth at government;
vast armies, disbanding, were becoming dully
restless; and armed men, disarming, began to wonder
what now might be their destiny and what the destiny
of the world they fought for.</p>
<p>And everywhere, among all peoples, swarmed the
stealthy agents of the Red Apocalypse, whispering discontent,
hinting treasons, stirring the unhappy to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
sullen anger, inciting the simple-minded to insanity, the
ignorant to revolution. For four years it had been
a battle between Light and Night; and now there
threatened to be joined in battle the uttermost forces
of Evolution and Chaos&ndash;&ndash;the spiritual Armageddon at
last, where Life and Light and Order must fight a final
fight with Degeneracy, Darkness and Death.</p>
<p>And always, everywhere, that hell-born Crimson Tide
seemed to be rising. All newspapers were full of it,
sounding the universal alarm. And Civilisation merely
stared at the scarlet flood&ndash;&ndash;gawked stupidly and unstirring&ndash;&ndash;while
the far clamour of massacre throughout
Russia grew suddenly to a crashing discord in Berlin,
shaking the whole world with brazen dissonance.</p>
<p>Like the first ominous puff before the tempest, the
deadly breath of the Black Death&ndash;&ndash;called &ldquo;influenza,&rdquo;
but known of old among the verminous myriads of the
East&ndash;&ndash;swept over the earth from East to West. Millions
died; millions were yet to perish of it; yet the
dazed world, still half blind with blood and smoke, sat
helpless and unstirring, barring no gates to this
pestilence that stalked the stricken earth at noon-day.</p>
<p>New York, partly paralysed by sacrifice and the
blood-sucking antics of half-crazed congressmen, gorged
by six years feeding after decades of starvation, welcomed
the incoming soldiers in a bewildered sort of way,
making either an idiot&rsquo;s din of dissonance or gaping in
stupid silence as the huge troop-ships swept up the bay.</p>
<p>The battle fleet arrived&ndash;&ndash;the home squadron and the
&ldquo;6th battle squadron&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and lay towering along the
Hudson, while officers and jackies swarmed the streets&ndash;&ndash;streets
now thronged by wounded, too&ndash;&ndash;pallid
cripples in olive drab, limping along slowly beneath
lowering skies, with their citations and crosses and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
ribbons and wound chevrons in glinting gold under the
relighted lustres of the metropolis.</p>
<p>So the false mockery of Christmas came to the city&ndash;&ndash;a
forced festival, unutterably sad, for all that the end
of the war was subject of thanks in every church and
synagogue. And so the mystic feast ended, scarcely
heeded amid the slow, half-crippled groping for financial
readjustment in the teeth of a snarling and vindictive
Congress, mean in its envy, meaner in revenge&ndash;&ndash;a
domestic brand of sectional Bolsheviki as dirty and
degenerate as any anarchist in all Russia.</p>
<p>The President had sailed away&ndash;&ndash;(<i>Slava! Slava!
Nechevo!</i>)&ndash;&ndash;and the newspapers were preparing to tell
their disillusioned public all about it, if permitted.</p>
<p>And so dawned the New Year over the spreading
crimson flood, flecking the mounting tide with brighter
scarlet as it crept ever westward, ever wider, across a
wounded world.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Palla had not seen Jim for a very long time now.
Christmas passed, bringing neither gift nor message,
although she had sent him a little remembrance&ndash;&ndash;<i>The
Divine Pantheon</i>, by an unfrocked Anglican clergyman,
one Loxon Fettars, recently under detention pending investigation
concerning an alleged multiplicity of wives.</p>
<p>The New Year brought no greeting from him, either;
nobody she knew had seen him, and her pride had revolted
at writing him after she had telephoned and left
a message at his club&ndash;&ndash;her usual concession after a
stormy parting.</p>
<p>And there was another matter that was causing her
a constantly increasing unrest&ndash;&ndash;she had not seen Marya
for many a day.</p>
<p>Quiet grief for what now appeared to be a friendship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
ended&ndash;&ndash;at other times a tingle of bitterness that
he had let it end so relentlessly&ndash;&ndash;and sometimes, at
night, the secret dread&ndash;&ndash;eternally buried yet perennially
resurrected&ndash;&ndash;the still, hidden, ever-living fear of
Marya; these the girl knew, now, as part of life.</p>
<p>And went on, steadily, with her life&rsquo;s business, as
though moving toward a dark horizon where clouds
towered gradually higher, reflecting the glimmer of
unseen lightning.</p>
<p>Somehow, lately, a vague sensation of impending
trouble had invaded her; and she never entirely shook
it off, even in her lighter moods, when there was gay
company around her; or in the warm flush of optimistic
propaganda work; or in the increasingly exciting sessions
of the Combat Club, now interrupted nightly by
fierce outbreaks from emissaries of the Red Flag Club,
who were there to make mischief.</p>
<p>Also, there had been an innovation established among
her company of moderate socialists; a corps of missionary
speakers, who volunteered on certain nights to
speak from the classic soap-box on street corners, urging
the propaganda of their panacea, the Law of Love
and Service.</p>
<p>Twice already, despite her natural timidity and
dread of public speaking, Palla had faced idle, half-curious,
half sneering crowds just east or west of Broadway;
had struggled through with what she had come to
say; had gently replied to heckling, blushed under insult,
stood trembling by her guns to the end.</p>
<p>Ilse was more convincing, more popular with her gay
insouciance and infectious laughter, and her unexpected
and enchanting flashes of militancy, which always
interested the crowd.</p>
<p>And always, after these soap-box efforts, both Palla
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
and Ilse were insulted over the telephone by unknown
men. Their mail, also, invariably contained abusive
or threatening letters, and sometimes vile ones; and
Estridge purchased pistols for them both and exacted
pledges that they carry them at night.</p>
<p>On the evening selected for Palla&rsquo;s third essay in
street oratory, she slipped her pistol into her muff and
set out alone, not waiting for Ilse, who, with John
Estridge, was to have met her after dinner at her house,
and, as usual, accompany her to the place selected.</p>
<p>But they knew where she was to speak, and she did
not doubt they would turn up sooner or later at the
rendezvous.</p>
<p>All that day the dull, foreboding feeling had been
assailing her at intervals, and she had been unable to
free herself entirely from the vague depression.</p>
<p>The day had been grey; when she left the house a
drizzle had begun to wet the flagstones, and every
lamp-post was now hooded with ghostly iridescence.</p>
<p>She walked because she had need of exercise, not even
deigning to unfurl her umbrella against the mist which
spun silvery ovals over every electric globe along Fifth
Avenue, and now shrouded every building above the
fourth story in a cottony ocean of fog.</p>
<p>When finally she turned westward, the dark obscurity
of the cross-street seemed to stretch away into infinite
night and she hurried a little, scarcely realising why.</p>
<p>There did not seem to be a soul in sight&ndash;&ndash;she noticed
that&ndash;&ndash;yet suddenly, halfway down the street, she discovered
a man walking at her elbow, his rubber-shod
feet making no sound on the wet walk.</p>
<p>Palla had never before been annoyed by such attentions
in New York, yet she supposed it must be the
reason for the man&rsquo;s insolence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>She hastened her steps; he moved as swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know who you are, and
where you&rsquo;re going. And we&rsquo;ve stood just about
enough from you and your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the quick revulsion from annoyance and disgust
to a very lively flash of fright, Palla involuntarily
slackened her pace and widened the distance between her
and this unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better right-about-face and go home!&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;You talk too damn much with your face.
And we&rsquo;re going to stop you. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that her flash of fear turned to anger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; she said hotly; and hurried on, her hand
clutching the pistol in her wet muff, her eyes fixed on
the unknown man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a mind to dust you good and plenty right here,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Quit your running, now, and beat it back
again&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; His vise-like grip was on her left arm, almost
jerking her off her feet; and the next moment she
struck him with her loaded pistol full in the face.</p>
<p>As he veered away, she saw the seam open from his
cheek bone to his chin&ndash;&ndash;saw the white face suddenly
painted with wet scarlet.</p>
<p>The sight of the blood made her sick, but she kept
her pistol levelled, backing away westward all the while.</p>
<p>There was an iron railing near; he went over and
leaned against it as though stupefied.</p>
<p>And all the while she continued to retreat until,
behind her, his dim shape merged into the foggy dark.</p>
<p>Then Palla turned and ran. And she was still breathing
fast and unevenly when she came to that perfect
blossom of vulgarity and apotheosis of all American
sham&ndash;&ndash;Broadway&ndash;&ndash;where in the raw glare from a million
lights the senseless crowds swept north and south.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>And here, where Jew-manager and gentile ruled the
histrionic destiny of the United States&ndash;&ndash;here where
art, letters, service, industry, business had each developed
its own species of human prostitute&ndash;&ndash;two
muddy-brained torrents of humanity poured in opposite
directions, crowding, shoving, shuffling along in the endless,
hopeless Hunt for Happiness.</p>
<p>She had made, in the beginning of her street-corner
career, arrangements with a neighbouring boot-black to
furnish one soap-box on demand at a quarter of a
dollar rent for every evening.</p>
<p>She extracted the quarter from her purse and paid
the boy; carried the soap-box herself to the curb; and,
with that invariable access of fright which attacked her
at such moments, mounted it to face the first few people
who halted out of curiosity to see what else she meant
to do.</p>
<p>Columns of passing umbrellas hid her so that not
many people noticed her; but gradually that perennial
audience of shabby opportunists which always gathers
anywhere from nowhere, ringed her soap-box. And
Palla began to speak in the drizzling rain.</p>
<p>For some time there were no interruptions, no jeers,
no doubtful pleasantries. But when it became more
plain to the increasing crowd that this smartly though
simply gowned young woman had come to Broadway
in the rain for the purpose of protesting against all
forms of violence, including the right of the working
people to strike, ugly remarks became audible, and now
and then a menacing word was flung at her, or some
clenched hand insulted her and amid a restless murmur
growing rougher all the time.</p>
<p>Once, to prove her point out of the mouth of the proletariat
itself, she quoted from Rosa Luxemburg; and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
well-dressed man shouldered his way toward her and in
a low voice gave her the lie.</p>
<p>The painful colour dyed her face, but she went on
calmly, explaining the different degrees and extremes
of socialism, revealing how the abused term had been
used as camouflage by the party committed to the utter
annihilation of everything worth living for.</p>
<p>And again, to prove her point, she quoted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Socialism does not mean the convening of Parliaments
and the enactment of laws; it means the overthrow
of the ruling classes with all the brutality at the
disposal of the proletariat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same well-dressed man interrupted again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who pays you to come here and hand out that
Wall Street stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody pays me,&rdquo; she replied patiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, if that&rsquo;s true why don&rsquo;t you tell us
something about the interests and the profiteers and
all them dirty games the capitalists is rigging up?
Tell us about the guy who wants us to pay eight cents
to ride on his damned cars! Tell us about the geezers
who soak us for food and coal and clothes and rent!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stand there chirping to us about Love and
Service and how we oughta give. <i>Give!</i> Jesus!&ndash;&ndash;we
ain&rsquo;t got anything left to give. They ain&rsquo;t anything to
give our wives or our children,&ndash;&ndash;no, nor there ain&rsquo;t
enough left to feed our own faces or pay for a patch
on our pants! <i>Give?</i> Hell! The interests <i>took</i> it.
And you stand there twittering about Love and Service!
We oughta serve &rsquo;em a brick on the neck and love
&rsquo;em with a black-jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far would that get you?&rdquo; asked Palla gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as their pants-pockets anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And when you empty those, who is to employ and
pay you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do the employing
after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will your employees do to you some day what
you did to your employers with a black-jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd laughed, but her heckler shook his fist
at her and yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I telling you that we&rsquo;ll be sitting in these
damn gold-plated houses and payin&rsquo; wages to these
here fat millionaires for blackin&rsquo; our shoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that when Bolshevism rules there are to
be rich and poor just the same as at present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the crowd laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; bawled the man, waving both arms above
his head, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;yes, I do mean it! It will be our turn
then. Why not? What do we want to split fifty-fifty
with them soft, fat millionaires for? Nix on that
stuff! It will be hog-killing time, and you can bet your
thousand-dollar wrist watch, Miss, that there&rsquo;ll be some
killin&rsquo; in little old New York!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had backed out of the circle and disappeared in
the crowd before Palla could attempt further reasoning
with him. So she merely shook her head in gentle disapproval
and dissent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of exchanging one form
of tyranny for another? Why destroy the autocracy
of the capitalist and erect on its ruins the autocracy
of the worker?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can class distinctions be eradicated by fanning
class-hatred? In a battle against all dictators, why
proclaim dictatorship&ndash;&ndash;even of the proletariat?</p>
<p>&ldquo;All oppression is hateful, whether exercised by God
or man&ndash;&ndash;whether the oppressor be that murderous,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
stupid, treacherous, tyrannical bully in the Old Testament,
miscalled God, or whether the oppressor be the
proletariat which screamed for the blood of Jesus
Christ and got it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free heart, free mind, free soul!&ndash;&ndash;anything less
means servitude, not service&ndash;&ndash;hatred, not love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man in the outskirts of the crowd shouted: &ldquo;Say,
you&rsquo;re some rag-chewer, little girl! Go to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, then glanced at her wrist watch.</p>
<p>There were a few more words she might say before
the time she allowed herself had expired, and she found
courage to go on, striving to explain to the shifting
knot of people that the battle which now threatened
civilisation was the terrible and final fight between
Order and Disorder and that, under inexorable laws
which could never change, order meant life and survival;
disorder chaos and death for all living things.</p>
<p>A few cheered her as she bade them good-night, picked
up her soap-box and carried it back to her boot-black
friend, who inhabited a shack built against the family-entrance
side of a saloon.</p>
<p>She was surprised that Ilse and John Estridge had
not appeared&ndash;&ndash;could scarcely understand it, as she
made her way toward a taxicab.</p>
<p>For, in view of the startling occurrence earlier in the
evening, and the non-appearance of Ilse and Estridge,
Palla had decided to return in a taxi.</p>
<p>The incident&ndash;&ndash;the boldness of the unknown man and
vicious brutality of his attitude, and also a sickening
recollection of her own action and his bloody face&ndash;&ndash;had
really shocked her, even more than she was aware of
at the time.</p>
<p>She felt tired and strained, and a trifle faint now,
where she lay back, swaying there on her seat, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
pistol clutched inside her muff, as the ramshackle vehicle
lurched its noisy way eastward. And always that dull
sense of something sinister impending&ndash;&ndash;that indefinable
apprehension&ndash;&ndash;remained with her. And she gazed
darkly out on the dark streets, possessed by a melancholy
which she did not attempt to analyse.</p>
<p>Yet, partly it came from the ruptured comradeship
which always haunted her mind, partly because of Ilse
and the uncertainty of what might happen to her&ndash;&ndash;may
have happened already for all Palla knew&ndash;&ndash;and
partly because&ndash;&ndash;although she did not realise it&ndash;&ndash;in the
profound deeps of her girl&rsquo;s being she was vaguely
conscious of something latent which seemed to have lain
hidden there for a long, long time&ndash;&ndash;something inert,
inexorable, indestructible, which, if it ever stirred from
its intense stillness, must be reckoned with in years to
come.</p>
<p>She made no effort to comprehend what this thing
might be&ndash;&ndash;if, indeed, it really existed&ndash;&ndash;no pains to
analyse it or to meditate over the vague indications
of its presence.</p>
<p>She seemed merely to be aware of something indefinable
concealed in the uttermost depths of her.</p>
<p>It was Doubt, unborn.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The taxi drew up before her house. Rain was falling
heavily, as she ran up the steps&ndash;&ndash;a cold rain through
which a few wet snowflakes slanted.</p>
<p>Her maid heard the rattle of her night-key and
came to relieve her of her wet things, and to say that
Miss Westgard had telephoned and had left a number
to be called as soon as Miss Dumont returned.</p>
<p>The slip of paper bore John Estridge&rsquo;s telephone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
number and Palla seated herself at her desk and called
it.</p>
<p>Almost immediately she heard Ilse&rsquo;s voice on the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, dear?&rdquo; inquired Palla with the
slightest shiver of that premonition which had haunted
her all day.</p>
<p>But Ilse&rsquo;s voice was cheerful: &ldquo;We were so sorry not
to go with you this evening, darling, but Jack is feeling
so queer that he&rsquo;s turned in and I&rsquo;ve sent for a physician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I come around?&rdquo; asked Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Ilse calmly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve an idea Jack
may need a nurse&ndash;&ndash;perhaps two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; faltered Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But he is running a high temperature
and he says that it feels as though something were
wrong with his appendix.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see Jack is almost a physician himself, so if
it really is acute appendicitis we must know as soon
as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there <i>anything</i> I could do?&rdquo; pleaded Palla.
&ldquo;Darling, I do so want to be of use if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know, dear. There isn&rsquo;t anything so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to stay there to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Ilse calmly. &ldquo;Tell me, Palla,
how did the soap-box arguments go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well. I was heckled. I&rsquo;m such a wretched
public speaker, Ilse;&ndash;&ndash;I can never remember what rejoinders
to make until it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not mention her encounter with the unknown
man; Ilse had enough to occupy her.</p>
<p>They chatted a few moments longer, then Ilse promised
to call her if necessary, and said good-night.</p>
<p>A little after midnight Palla&rsquo;s telephone rang beside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
her bed and she started upright with a pang of fear
and groped for the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack is seriously ill,&rdquo; came the level voice of Ilse.
&ldquo;We have taken him to the Memorial Hospital in one
of their ambulances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W&ndash;&ndash;what is it?&rdquo; asked Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say it is pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ilse!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. Jack is in magnificent physical
condition. He is too splendid not to win the fight....
And I shall be with him.... I shall not
let him lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what I can do, darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;except love us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&ndash;&ndash;I do indeed&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both, Palla!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&ndash;&ndash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do you understand?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&ndash;&ndash;I think I do. And I do love you&ndash;&ndash;love you
both&ndash;&ndash;devotedly&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must, <i>now</i>.... I am going home to get
some things. Then I shall go to the hospital. You
can call me there until he is convalescent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they let you stay there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have volunteered for general work. They are
terribly short-handed and they are glad to have me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to-morrow,&rdquo; said Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Wait.... Good-night, my darling.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>
<p>As a mischievous caricaturist, in the beginning,
draws a fairly good portrait of his victim and
then gradually habituates his public to a series
of progressively exaggerated extravagances, so progressed
the programme of the Bolsheviki in America,
revealing little by little their final conception of liberty
and equality in the bloody and distorted monster which
they had now evolved, and which they publicly owned
as their ideal emblem.</p>
<p>In the Red Flag Club, Sondheim shouted that a Red
Republic was impossible because it admitted on an
equality the rich and well-to-do.</p>
<p>Karl Kastner, more cynical, coolly preached the autocracy
of the worker; told his listeners frankly that
there would always be masters and servants in the
world, and asked them which they preferred to be.</p>
<p>With the new year came sporadic symptoms of
unrest;&ndash;&ndash;strikes, unwarranted confiscations by Government,
increasingly bad service in public utilities controlled
by Government, loose talk in a contemptible
Congress, looser gabble among those who witlessly lent
themselves to German or Bolshevik propaganda&ndash;&ndash;or
both&ndash;&ndash;by repeating stories of alleged differences between
America and England, America and France,
America and Italy.</p>
<p>The hen-brained&ndash;&ndash;a small minority&ndash;&ndash;misbehaved as
usual whenever the opportunity came to do the wrong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
thing; the meanest and most contemptible partisanship
since the shameful era of the carpet bagger prevailed
in a section of the Republic where the traditions of
great men and great deeds had led the nation to expect
nobler things.</p>
<p>For the same old hydra seemed to be still alive on
earth, lifting, by turns, its separate heads of envy,
intolerance, bigotry and greed. Ignorance, robed with
authority, legally robbed those comfortably off.</p>
<p>The bleat of the pacifist was heard in the land.
Those who had once chanted in sanctimonious chorus,
&ldquo;He kept us out of war,&rdquo; now sang sentimental hymns
invoking mercy and forgiveness for the crucifiers of
children and the rapers of women, who licked their lips
furtively and leered at the imbecile choir. Representatives
of a great electorate vaunted their patriotism
and proudly repeated: &ldquo;We forced him into war!&rdquo;
Whereas they themselves had been kicked headlong
into it by a press and public at the end of its martyred
patience.</p>
<p>There appeared to be, so far, no business revival.
Prosperity was penalised, taxed to the verge of blackmail,
constantly suspected and admonished; and the
Congressional Bolsheviki were gradually breaking the
neck of legitimate enterprise everywhere throughout
the Republic.</p>
<p>And everywhere over the world the crimson tide crept
almost imperceptibly a little higher every day.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Toward the middle of January the fever which had
burnt John Estridge for a week fell a degree or two.</p>
<p>Palla, who had called twice a day at the Memorial
Hospital, was seated that morning in a little room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
near the disinfecting plant, talking to Ilse, who had
just laid aside her mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look rather ill yourself,&rdquo; said Ilse in her cheery,
even voice. &ldquo;Is anything worrying you, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... You are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, really astonished. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; murmured Palla, &ldquo;my anxiety makes
me almost sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anxiety about <i>me</i>!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know why,&rdquo; whispered Palla.</p>
<p>A bright flush stained Ilse&rsquo;s face: she said calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our creed is broad enough to include all things
beautiful and good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla shrank as though she had been struck, and sat
staring out of the narrow window.</p>
<p>Ilse lifted a basket of soiled linen and carried it
away. When, presently, she returned to take away
another basket, she inquired whether Palla had made
up her quarrel with Jim Shotwell, and Palla shook her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really suppose Marya has made mischief
between you?&rdquo; asked Ilse curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, Ilse,&rdquo; said the girl listlessly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what it is that seems to be so wrong with
the world&ndash;&ndash;with everybody&ndash;&ndash;with me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose nervously, bade Ilse adieu, and went out
without turning her head&ndash;&ndash;perhaps because her brown
eyes had suddenly blurred with tears.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Half way to Red Cross headquarters she passed the
Hotel Rajah. And why she did it she had no very
clear idea, but she turned abruptly and entered the
gorgeous lobby, went to the desk, and sent up her name
to Marya Lanois.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>It appeared, presently, that Miss Lanois was at home
and would receive her in her apartment.</p>
<p>The accolade was perfunctory: Palla&rsquo;s first glance
informed her that Marya had grown a trifle more
svelte since they had met&ndash;&ndash;more brilliant in her distinctive
coloration. There was a tawny beauty about
the girl that almost blazed from her hair and delicately
sanguine skin and lips.</p>
<p>They seated themselves, and Marya lighted the cigarette
which Palla had refused; and they fell into the
animated, gossiping conversation characteristic of such
reunions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanya?&rdquo; repeated Marya, smiling, &ldquo;no, I have not
seen him. That is quite finished, you see. But I hope
he is well. Do you happen to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems&ndash;&ndash;changed. But he is working hard, which
is always best for the unhappy. And he and his somewhat
vociferous friend, Mr. Wilding, are very busy
preparing for their Philadelphia concert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilding,&rdquo; repeated Marya, as though swallowing
something distasteful. &ldquo;He was the last straw! But
tell me, Palla, what are you doing these jolly days of
the new year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.... Red Cross, canteen, club&ndash;&ndash;and recently
I go twice a day to the Memorial Hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Estridge is ill there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. I am so sorry for Ilse!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her eyes rested
intently on Palla&rsquo;s for a moment; then she smiled subtly,
as though sharing with Palla some occult understanding.</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s face whitened a little: &ldquo;I want to ask you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
a question, Marya.... You know our belief&ndash;&ndash;concerning
life in general.... Tell me&ndash;&ndash;since
your separation from Vanya, do you still believe in
that creed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I still believe in my own personal liberty to do
as I choose? Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the moral side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moral!&rdquo; mocked Marya, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;What are morals?
Artificial conventions accidentally established! Haphazard
folkways of ancient peoples whose very origin
has been forgotten! What is moral in India is immoral
in England: what is right in China is wrong in
America. It&rsquo;s purely a matter of local folkways&ndash;&ndash;racial
customs&ndash;&ndash;as to whether one is or is not immoral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethics apply to the Greek <i>Ethos</i>; morals to the
Latin <i>Mores</i>&ndash;&ndash;<i>moeurs</i> in French, <i>sitte</i> in German,
<i>custom</i> in English;&ndash;&ndash;and all mean practically the same
thing&ndash;&ndash;metaphysical hair-splitters to the contrary&ndash;&ndash;which
is simply this: all beliefs are local, and local
customs or morals are the result. Therefore, they don&rsquo;t
worry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla sat with her troubled eyes on the careless,
garrulous, half-smiling Russian girl, and trying to
follow with an immature mind the half-baked philosophy
offered for her consumption.</p>
<p>She said hesitatingly, almost shyly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered
a little, Marya, how it ever happened that such an
institution as marriage became practically universal&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage isn&rsquo;t an institution,&rdquo; exclaimed Marya
smilingly. &ldquo;The family, which existed long before
marriage, is the institution, because it has a definite
structure which marriage hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage always has been merely a locally varying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
mode of sex association. No laws can control it. Local
rules merely try to regulate the various manners of
entering into a marital state, the obligations and personal
rights of the sexes involved. What really controls
two people who have entered into such a relation
is local opinion&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snapped her fingers and tossed aside her cigarette:
&ldquo;You and I happen to be, locally, in the minority
with our opinions, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla rose and walked slowly to the door. &ldquo;Have
you seen Jim recently?&rdquo; she managed to say carelessly.</p>
<p>Marya waited for her to turn before replying:
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t <i>you</i> seen him?&rdquo; she asked with the leisurely
malice of certainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not for a long while,&rdquo; replied Palla, facing
with a painful flush this miserable crisis to which her
candour had finally committed her. &ldquo;We had a little
difference.... Have you seen him lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marya&rsquo;s sympathy flickered swift as a dagger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a shame for him to behave so childishly!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;I shall scold him soundly. He&rsquo;s like an infant&ndash;&ndash;that
boy&ndash;&ndash;the way he sulks if you deny him anything&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
She checked herself, laughed in a confused
way which confessed and defied.</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s fixed smile was still stamped on her rigid
lips as she made her adieux. Then she went out with
death in her heart.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At the Red Cross his mother exchanged a few words
with her at intervals, as usual, during the s&eacute;ance.</p>
<p>The conversation drifted toward the subject of religious
orders in Russia, and Mrs. Shotwell asked her how
it was that she came to begin a novitiate in a country
where Catholic orders had, she understood, been forbidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
permission to establish themselves in the realm
of the Greek church.</p>
<p>Palla explained in her sweet, colourless voice that the
Czar had permitted certain religious orders to establish
themselves&ndash;&ndash;very few, however,&ndash;&ndash;the number of
nuns of all orders not exceeding five hundred. Also
she explained that they were forbidden to make converts
from the orthodox religion, which was why the Empress
had sternly refused the pleading of the little Grand
Duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; added Palla, &ldquo;that the Bolsheviki
have left any Catholic nuns in Russia, unless perhaps
they have spared the Sisters of Mercy. But I hear that
non-cloistered orders like the Dominicans, and cloistered
orders such as the Carmelites and Ursulines have
been driven away.... I don&rsquo;t know whether this
is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Shotwell, her eyes on her flying needle, said
casually: &ldquo;Have you never felt the desire to reconsider&ndash;&ndash;to
return to your novitiate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, bending low over her work, drew a deep,
still breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it has occurred to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it still appeal to you at times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl lifted her honest eyes: &ldquo;In life there are
moments when any refuge appeals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refuge from what?&rdquo; asked Helen quietly.</p>
<p>Palla did not evade the question: &ldquo;From the unkindness
of life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I have concluded that
such a motive for cloistered life is a cowardly one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that your motive when you took the white
veil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not then.... It seemed to be an overwhelming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
need for service and adoration.... It&rsquo;s
strange how faiths change though need remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still feel that need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the girl simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Your clubs and other service give you what
you require to satisfy you and make you happy and
contented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Palla made no reply, Helen glanced at her askance;
and caught a fleeting glimpse of tragedy in this girl&rsquo;s still
face&ndash;&ndash;the face of a cloistered nun burnt white&ndash;&ndash;purged
utterly of all save the mystic passion of the spirit.</p>
<p>The face altered immediately, and colour came into
it; and her slender hands were steady as she turned
her bandage and cut off the thread.</p>
<p>What thoughts concerning this girl were in her mind,
Helen could neither entirely comprehend nor analyse.
At moments a hot hatred for the girl passed over her
like flame&ndash;&ndash;anger because of what she was doing to her
only son.</p>
<p>For Jim had changed; and it was love for this woman
that had changed him&ndash;&ndash;which had made of him the
silent, listless man whose grey face haunted his mother&rsquo;s
dreams.</p>
<p>That he, dissipating all her hopes of him, had fallen
in love with Palla Dumont was enough unhappiness,
it seemed; but that this girl should have found it
possible to refuse him&ndash;&ndash;that seemed to Helen a monstrous
thing.</p>
<p>And even were Jim able to forget the girl and free
himself from this exasperating unhappiness which almost
maddened his mother, still she must always afterward
remember with bitterness the girl who had rejected her
only son.</p>
<p>Not since Palla had telephoned on that unfortunate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
night had she or Helen ever mentioned Jim. The
mother, expecting his obsession to wear itself out, had
been only too glad to approve the rupture.</p>
<p>But recently, at moments, her courage had weakened
when, evening after evening, she had watched her son
where he sat so silent, listless, his eyes dull and remote
and the book forgotten on his knees.</p>
<p>A steady resentment for all this change in her son
possessed Helen, varied by flashes of impulse to seize
Palla and shake her into comprehension of her responsibility&ndash;&ndash;of
her astounding stupidity, perhaps.</p>
<p>Not that she wanted her for a daughter-in-law.
She wanted Elorn. But now she was beginning to
understand that it never would be Elorn Sharrow.
And&ndash;&ndash;save when the change in Jim worried her too
deeply&ndash;&ndash;she remained obstinately determined that he
should not bring this girl into the Shotwell family.</p>
<p>And the amazing paradox was revealed in the fact
that Palla fascinated her; that she believed her to be
as fine as she was perverse; as honest as she was beautiful;
as spiritually chaste as she knew her to be mentally
and bodily untainted by anything ignoble.</p>
<p>This, and because Palla was the woman to whom
her son&rsquo;s unhappiness was wholly due, combined to
exercise an uncanny fascination on Helen, so that she
experienced a constant and haunting desire to be near
the girl, where she could see her and hear her voice.</p>
<p>At moments, even, she experienced a vague desire to
intervene&ndash;&ndash;do something to mitigate Jim&rsquo;s misery&ndash;&ndash;yet
realising all the while she did not desire Palla to
relent.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>As for Palla, she was becoming too deeply worried
over the darkening aspects of life to care what Helen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
thought, even if she had divined the occult trend of
her mind toward herself.</p>
<p>One thing after another seemed to crowd more
threateningly upon her;&ndash;&ndash;Jim&rsquo;s absence, Marya&rsquo;s attitude,
and the certainty, now, that she saw Jim;&ndash;&ndash;and
then the grave illness of John Estridge and her
apprehensions regarding Ilse; and the increasing difficulties
of club problems; and the brutality and hatred
which were becoming daily more noticeable in the opposition
which she and Ilse were encountering.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>After a tiresome day, Palla left a new Hostess
House which she had aided to establish, and took a
Fifth Avenue bus, too weary to walk home.</p>
<p>The day had been clear and sunny, and she wondered
dully why it had left with her the impression of grey
skies.</p>
<p>Dusk came before she arrived at her house. She went
into her unlighted living room, and threw herself on
the lounge, lying with eyes closed and the back of one
gloved hand across her temples.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When a servant came to turn up the lamp, Palla
had bitten her lip till the blood flecked her white glove.
She sat up, declined to have tea, and, after the maid
had departed, she remained seated, her teeth busy with
her under lip again, her eyes fixed on space.</p>
<p>After a long while her eyes swerved to note the
clock and what its gilt hands indicated.</p>
<p>And she seemed to arrive at a conclusion, for she
went to her bedroom, drew a bath, and rang for her
maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my rose evening gown,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It needs
a stitch or two where I tore it dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></div>
<p>At six, not being dressed yet, she put on a belted
chamber robe and trotted into the living room, as confidently
as though she had no doubts concerning what
she was about to do.</p>
<p>It seemed to take a long while for the operator to
make the connection, and Palla&rsquo;s hand trembled a little
where it held the receiver tightly against her ear.
When, presently, a servant answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please say to him that a client wishes to speak to
him regarding an investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally she heard his voice saying: &ldquo;This is Mr.
James Shotwell Junior; who is it wishes to speak to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A client,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;who desires to&ndash;&ndash;to
participate with you in some plan for the purpose of&ndash;&ndash;of
improving our mutual relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palla.&rdquo; She could scarcely hear his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m so unhappy, Jim. Could you come to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you haven&rsquo;t heard that Jack Estridge
is very ill?&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What is the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pneumonia. He&rsquo;s a little better to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard him utter: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible. That&rsquo;s a bad
business.&rdquo; Then to her: &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him. He said he&rsquo;d call at the hospital.
But he said nothing about seeing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wondered,&rdquo; came her wistful voice, &ldquo;whether, perhaps,
you would dine here alone with me this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;our last quarrel was so bitter&ndash;&ndash;and
I feel the hurt of it yet. It hurts even physically,
Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to do such a thing to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know you didn&rsquo;t. But that numb sort of
pain is always there. I can&rsquo;t seem to get rid of it, no
matter what I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you very busy still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... I saw&ndash;&ndash;Marya&ndash;&ndash;to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that unusual?&rdquo; he asked indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I haven&rsquo;t seen her since&ndash;&ndash;since she and Vanya
separated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Have they separated?&rdquo; he asked with such
unfeigned surprise that the girl&rsquo;s heart leaped wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know it? Didn&rsquo;t Marya tell you?&rdquo; she
asked shivering with happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her since I saw you,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s right hand flew to her breast and rested there
while she strove to control her voice. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Jim, let us forgive and break bread again
together. I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she drew a deep, unsteady breath&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t tell you how our separation has made me feel.
I don&rsquo;t quite know what it&rsquo;s done to me, either. Perhaps
I can understand if I see you&ndash;&ndash;if I could only
see you again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There ensued a silence so protracted that a shaft of
fear struck through her. Then his voice, pleasantly
collected:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be around in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She was scared speechless when the bell rang&ndash;&ndash;when
she heard his unhurried step on the stair.</p>
<p>Before he was announced by the maid, however, she
had understood one problem in the scheme of things&ndash;&ndash;realised
it as she rose from the lounge and held out
her slender hand.</p>
<p>He took it and kept it. The maid retired.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Palla,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, rather breathlessly, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;I know
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice and face seemed amiable and lifeless; his
eyes, too, remained dull and incurious; but he said:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand. What is it you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His pleasant, listless manner chilled her; she hesitated,
then turned away, withdrawing her hand.</p>
<p>When she had seated herself on the sofa he dropped
down beside her in his old place. She lighted a cigarette
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about poor old Jack,&rdquo; he said in a low
voice.</p>
<p>Their dinner was a pleasant but subdued affair.
Afterward she played for him&ndash;&ndash;interrupted once by
a telephone call from Ilse, who said that John&rsquo;s temperature
had risen a degree and the only thing to do was
to watch him every second. But she refused Palla&rsquo;s offer
to join her at the hospital, saying that she and the
night nurse were sufficient; and the girl went slowly
back to the piano.</p>
<p>But, somehow, even that seemed too far away from
her lover&ndash;&ndash;or the man who once had been her avowed
lover. And after idling-with the keys for a few minutes
she came back to the lounge where he was seated.</p>
<p>He looked up from his revery: &ldquo;This is most comfortable,
Palla,&rdquo; he said with a slight smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not go away at all&ndash;&ndash;if it pleases you.&rdquo;
Her voice was so indistinct that for a moment he did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
not comprehend what she had said. Then he turned
and looked at her. Both were pale enough now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what&ndash;&ndash;what I was going to tell you,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Is it too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say that I am&ndash;&ndash;in love with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flushed heavily and looked at her in a dazed way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean&ndash;&ndash;if you want me&ndash;&ndash;I am&ndash;&ndash;am not afraid any
more&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had both risen instinctively, as though to face
something vital. She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to submit to any degrading ceremony....
I love you enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said slowly: &ldquo;Do you realise what you say?
You are crazy! You and your socialist friends pretend
to be fighting anarchy. You preach against
Bolshevism! You warn the world that the Crimson
Tide is rising. And every word you utter swells it!
<i>You</i> are the anarchists yourselves! You are the Bolsheviki
of the world! You come bringing disorder
where there is order; you substitute unproven theory
for proven practice!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the hun, you come to impose your will on a
world already content with its own God and its own
belief! And that is autocracy; and autocracy is what
you say you oppose!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you and your friends that it was not wolves
that were pupped in the sand of the shaggy Prussian
forests when the first Hohenzollern was dropped. It
was swine! Swine were farrowed;&ndash;&ndash;not even <i>sanglier</i>,
but decadent domestic swine;&ndash;&ndash;when Wilhelm and his
degenerate litter came out to root up Europe! And
<i>they</i> were the first real Bolsheviki!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>He turned and began to stride to and fro; his pale,
sunken face deeply shadowed, his hands clenching and
unclenching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; he said fiercely, &ldquo;are women
like you doing to us! What do you suppose happens
to such a man as I when the girl he loves tells him
she cares only to be his mistress! What hope is there
left in him?&ndash;&ndash;what sense, what understanding, what
faith?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me that the Crimson Tide
is rising. I saw it in the Argonne. I wish to God I
were back there and the hun was still resisting. I wish
I had never lived to come back here and see what demoralisation
is threatening my own country from that
cursed germ of wilful degeneracy born in the Prussian
twilight, fed in Russian desolation, infecting the whole
world&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice died in his throat; he walked swiftly past
her, turned at the threshold:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known three of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;you and Ilse
and Marya. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of your associates and
acquaintances who profess your views. And I&rsquo;ve seen
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated; then when he could control his voice
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough when a woman refuses marriage
to a man she does not love. That man is going to be
unhappy. But have you any idea what happens to
him when the girl he loves, and who says she cares
for him, refuses marriage?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was terrible even when you cared for me only a
little. But&ndash;&ndash;but now&ndash;&ndash;do you know what I think of
your creed? I hate it as you hated the beasts who slew
your friend! Damn your creed! To hell with it!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>She covered her face with both hands: there was a
noise like thunder in her brain.</p>
<p>She heard the door close sharply in the hall below.</p>
<p>This was the end.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
<a name='CHAPTER_XXII' id='CHAPTER_XXII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p>She felt a trifle weak. In her ears there lingered
a dull, confused sensation, like the echo of things
still falling. Something had gone very wrong
with the scheme of nature. Even beneath her feet,
now, the floor seemed unsteady, unreliable.</p>
<p>A half-darkness dimmed her eyes; she laid one slim
hand on the sofa-back and seated herself, fighting instinctively
for consciousness.</p>
<p>She sat there for a long while. The swimming faintness
passed away. An intense stillness seemed to invade
her, and the room, and the street outside. And for
vast distances beyond. Half hours and hours rang
clearly through the silence from the mantel-clock. So
still was the place that a sheaf of petals falling from
a fading rose on the piano seemed to fill the room with
ghostly rustling.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>This, then, was the finish. Love had ended. Youth
itself was ending, too, here in the dead silence of this
lamplit room.</p>
<p>There remained nothing more. Except that ever
darkening horizon where, at the earth&rsquo;s ends, those
grave shapes of cloud closed out the vista of remote
skies.</p>
<p>There seemed to be no shelter anywhere in the vast
nakedness of the scheme of things&ndash;&ndash;no shadow under
which to crouch&ndash;&ndash;no refuge.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></div>
<p>Dim visions of cloistered forms, moving in a blessed
twilight, grew and assumed familiar shape amid the
dumb desolation reigning in her brain. The spectral
temptation passed, repassed; processional, recessional
glided by, timed by her heart&rsquo;s low rhythm.</p>
<p>But, little by little, she came to understand that there
was no refuge even there; no mystic glow in the dark
corridors of her own heart; no source of light save
from the candles glimmering on the high altar; no
aureole above the crucifix.</p>
<p>Always, everywhere, there seemed to be no shelter,
no roof above the scheme of things.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She heard the telephone. As she slowly rose from
the sofa she noted the hour as it sounded;&ndash;&ndash;four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>A man&rsquo;s voice was speaking&ndash;&ndash;an unhurried, precise,
low-pitched, monotonous voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;Memorial Hospital. Doctor&ndash;&ndash;Willis&ndash;&ndash;speaking.
Mr.&ndash;&ndash;John&ndash;&ndash;Estridge&ndash;&ndash;died&ndash;&ndash;at&ndash;&ndash;ten minutes&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;four.
Miss Westgard&ndash;&ndash;wishes&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;go&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;your&ndash;&ndash;residence&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;remain&ndash;&ndash;over&ndash;&ndash;night&ndash;&ndash;if&ndash;&ndash;convenient....
Thank you. Miss&ndash;&ndash;Westgard&ndash;&ndash;will&ndash;&ndash;go&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;immediately. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Palla rose from her chair in the unfurnished drawing-room,
went out into the hall, admitted Ilse, then locked
and chained the two front doors.</p>
<p>When she turned around, trembling and speechless,
they kissed. But it was only Palla&rsquo;s mouth that
trembled; and when they mounted the stairs it was
Ilse&rsquo;s arm that supported Palla.</p>
<p>Except that her eyes were heavy and seemed smeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
with deep violet under the lower lids, Ilse did not appear
very much changed.</p>
<p>She took off her furs, hat, and gloves and sat down
beside Palla. Her voice was quite clear and steady;
there appeared to be no sign of shock or of grief, save
for a passing tremor of her tired eyes now and then.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;We talked a little together, Jack and I,
after I telephoned to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the last. His hand began to burn in
mine steadily, like something on fire. And when, presently,
I found he was not asleep, I motioned to the
night nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The change seemed to come suddenly; she went to
find one of the internes; I sat with my hand on his
pulse.... There were three physicians there....
Jack was not conscious after midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s lips and throat were dry and aching and her
voice almost inaudible:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;darling&ndash;&ndash;if I could
give him back to you and take his place!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse smiled, but her heavy eyelids quivered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scheme of things is so miserably patched together....
Except for the indestructible divinity
within each one of us, it all would be so hopeless....
I had never been able to imagine Jack and
Death together&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She looked up at the clock. &ldquo;He
was alive only an hour ago.... Isn&rsquo;t it strange&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ilse, Ilse! I wish this God who deals out such
wickedness and misery had struck me down instead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither seemed to notice the agnostic paradox in this
bitter cry wrung from a young girl&rsquo;s grief.</p>
<p>Ilse closed her eyes as though to rest them, and sat
so, her steady hand on Palla&rsquo;s. And, so resting, said
in her unfaltering voice:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, of course, lives.... But it seems a long
time to wait to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack lives,&rdquo; whispered Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.... Only&ndash;&ndash;it seems so long a time to
wait.... I wanted to show him&ndash;&ndash;how kind love has
been to us&ndash;&ndash;how still more wonderful love could have
been to us ... for I could have borne him many
children.... And now I shall bear but one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a silence, Palla lifted her eyes. In them the
shadow of terror still lingered; there was not an atom
of colour in her face.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Ilse slept that night, though Palla scarcely closed
her eyes. Dreadful details of the coming day rose up
to haunt her&ndash;&ndash;all the ghastly routine necessary before
the dead lie finally undisturbed by the stir and movement
of many footsteps&ndash;&ndash;the coming and going of the
living.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Because what they called pneumonia was the Black
Death of the ancient East, they had warned Ilse to
remain aloof from that inert thing that had been her
lover. So she did not look upon his face again.</p>
<p>There were relatives of sorts at the chapel. None
spoke to her. The sunshine on the flower-covered
casket was almost spring like.</p>
<p>And in the cemetery, too, there was no snow; and,
under the dead grass, everywhere new herbage tinted
the earth with delicate green.</p>
<p>Ilse returned from the cemetery with Palla. Her
black veil and garments made of her gold hair and
blond skin a vivid beauty that grief had not subdued.</p>
<p>That deathless courage which was part of her seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
to sustain the clear glow of her body&rsquo;s vigour as it
upheld her dauntless spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Jim in the chapel?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>
<p>Palla nodded. She had seen Marya, also. After a
little while Ilse said gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it no treachery to creed when one submits
to the equally vital belief of another. I think our creed
includes submission, because that also is part of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla lifted her face in flushed surprise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any compromising with truth?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think love is the greatest truth. What difference
does it make how we love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does not our example count? You had the courage
of your belief. Do you counsel me to subscribe to
what I do not believe by acquiescing in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse closed her sea-blue eyes as though fatigued. She
said dreamily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that to believe in love and mating and the
bearing of children is the only important belief in the
world. But under what local laws you go about doing
these things seems to be of minor importance,&ndash;&ndash;a matter,
I should say, of personal inclination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse wished to go home. That is, to her own apartment,
where now were enshrined all her memories of
this dead man who had given to her womanhood that
ultimate crown which in her eyes seemed perfect.</p>
<p>She said serenely to Palla: &ldquo;Mine is not the loneliness
that craves company with the living. I have a
long time to wait; that is all. And after a while I
shall not wait alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you must not grieve for me, darling. You see
I know that Jack lives. It&rsquo;s just the long, long wait
that calls for courage. But I think it is a little easier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
to wait alone until&ndash;&ndash;until there are two to wait&ndash;&ndash;for
him&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you call me when you want me, Ilse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always, darling. Don&rsquo;t grieve. Few women know
happiness. I have known it. I know it now. It shall
not even die with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled faintly and turned to enter her doorway;
and Palla continued on alone toward that dwelling
which she called home.</p>
<p>The mourning which she had worn for her aunt, and
which she had worn for John Estridge that morning,
she now put off, although vaguely inclined for it. But
she shrank from the explanations in which it was certain
she must become involved when on duty at the
Red Cross and the canteen that afternoon.</p>
<p>Undressed, she sent her maid for a cup of tea, feeling
too tired for luncheon. Afterward she lay down
on her bed, meaning merely to close her eyes for a
moment.</p>
<p>It was after four in the afternoon when she sat up
with a start&ndash;&ndash;too late for the Red Cross; but she could
do something at the canteen.</p>
<p>She went about dressing as though bruised. It
seemed to take an interminable time. Her maid called
a taxi; but the short winter daylight had nearly gone
when she arrived at the canteen.</p>
<p>She remained there on kitchen duty until seven, then
untied her white tablier, washed, pinned on her hat,
and went out into the light-shot darkness of the streets
and turned her steps once more toward home.</p>
<p>There is, among the weirder newspapers of the
metropolis, a sheet affectionately known as &ldquo;pink-and-punk,&rdquo;
the circulation of which seems to depend upon
its distribution of fake &ldquo;extras.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>As Palla turned into her street, shabby men with
hoarse voices were calling an extra and selling the newspaper
in question.</p>
<p>She bought one, glanced at the headlines, then, folding
it, unlocked her door.</p>
<p>Dinner was announced almost immediately, but she
could not touch it.</p>
<p>She sank down on the sofa, still wearing her furs and
hat. After a little while she opened her newspaper.</p>
<p>It seemed that a Bolsheviki plot had been discovered
to murder the premiers and rulers of the allied nations,
and to begin simultaneously in every capital and principal
city of Europe and America a reign of murder
and destruction.</p>
<p>In fact, according to the account printed in startling
type, the Terrorists had already begun their destructive
programme in Philadelphia. Half a dozen buildings&ndash;&ndash;private
dwellings and one small hotel&ndash;&ndash;had been more
or less damaged by bombs. A New York man named
Wilding, fairly well known as an impresario, had been
killed outright; and a Russian pianist, Vanya Tchernov,
who had just arrived in Philadelphia to complete arrangements
for a concert to be given by him under
Mr. Wilding&rsquo;s management, had been fatally injured
by the collapse of the hotel office which, at that moment,
he was leaving in company with Mr. Wilding.</p>
<p>A numbness settled over Palla&rsquo;s brain. She did not
seem to be able to comprehend that this affair concerned
Vanya&ndash;&ndash;that this newspaper was telling her that Vanya
had been fatally hurt somewhere in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Hours later, while she was lying on the lounge with
her face buried in the cushions, and still wearing her
hat and furs, somebody came into the room. And when
she turned over she saw it was Ilse.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>Palla sat up stupidly, the marks of tears still glistening
under her eyes. Ilse picked up the newspaper from
the couch, laid it aside, and seated herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you know about Vanya?&rdquo; she said calmly.</p>
<p>Palla nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know all. Marya called me on the telephone
a few minutes ago to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanya is dead,&rdquo; whispered Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They found an unmailed letter directed to
Marya in his pockets. That&rsquo;s why they notified her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After an interval: &ldquo;So Vanya is dead,&rdquo; repeated
Palla under her breath.</p>
<p>Ilse sat plaiting the black edges of her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a&ndash;&ndash;a senseless interruption&ndash;&ndash;death&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;It seems so wanton, so meaningless in
the scheme of things ... to make two people wait
so long&ndash;&ndash;so long!&ndash;&ndash;to resume where they had been
interrupted&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla asked coldly whether Marya had seemed
greatly shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Palla. She called me up and told me.
I asked her if there was anything I could do; and she
answered rather strangely that what remained for her
to do she would do alone. I don&rsquo;t know what she
meant.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Whether Marya herself knew exactly what she meant
seemed not to be entirely clear to her. For, when Mr.
Puma, dressed in a travelling suit and carrying a
satchel, arrived at her apartment in the Hotel Rajah,
and entered the reception room with his soundless,
springy step, she came out of her bedroom partly
dressed, and still hooking her waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; she demanded contemptuously,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
looking him over from, head to foot. &ldquo;Did
you really suppose I meant to go to Mexico with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heavy features crimsoned: &ldquo;What pleasantry is
this, my Marya?&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began; but the green blaze
in her slanting eyes silenced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difference,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;between us is this. You
run from those who threaten you. I kill them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of&ndash;&ndash;of what nonsense are you speaking!&rdquo; he stammered.
&ldquo;All is arranged that we shall go at
eleven&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said wearily, &ldquo;one sometimes plays with
stray animals for a few moments&ndash;&ndash;and that is all. And
that is all I ever saw in you, Angelo&ndash;&ndash;a stray beast
to amuse and entertain me between two yawns and a
cup of tea.&rdquo; She shrugged, still twisted lithely in her
struggle to hook her waist. &ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; she added,
not even looking at him, &ldquo;or, if you are not too
cowardly, you may come with me to the Red Flag Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name what do you mean&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean? I mean to take my pistol to the Red Flag
Club and kill some Bolsheviki. That is what I mean,
my Angelo&ndash;&ndash;my ruddy Eurasian pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped in the last hook, turned and enveloped
him again with an insolent, slanting glance: &ldquo;<i>Allons!</i>
Do you come to the Red Flag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marya&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes or no! <i>Allez!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, are&ndash;&ndash;are you then demented?&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; she mimicked him, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t
answer for what I might do to you if you hang around
this apartment any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came slowly toward him, her hands bracketed on
her hips, her strange eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have loved many times.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
But never <i>you</i>! One doesn&rsquo;t love your kind. One experiments,
possibly, if idle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man died to-day whom I loved; but was too stupid
to love enough. Perhaps he knows now how stupid
I am.... Unless they blew his soul to pieces,
also. <i>Allez!</i> Good-night. I tell you I have business
to attend to, and you stand there rolling your woman&rsquo;s
eyes at me!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he said between his teeth. &ldquo;What is
the matter with you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had caught her arm; she wrenched it free, tearing
the sleeve to her naked shoulder.</p>
<p>Then she went to her desk and took a pistol from an
upper drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall have to shoot
you and leave you here kicking on the carpet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, Marya!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, &ldquo;who
is it you shall kill at the hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall kill Sondheim and Bromberg and Kastner,
I hope. What of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;if I go to-night&ndash;&ndash;the others will say <i>I</i> did it!
I can&rsquo;t run away if you do such thing! I can not go
into Mexico but they shall arrest me before I am at
the border&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eurasian pig, I shall admit the killing!&rdquo; she said
with a green gleam in her eyes that perhaps was
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Marya,&rdquo; he explained in agony, the sweat
pouring from his temples, &ldquo;but if they think me your
accomplice they shall arrest me. Me&ndash;&ndash;I can not wait&ndash;&ndash;I
shall be ruined if I am arrest! You do not comprehend.
I have not said it to you how it is that I am
compel to travel with some money which&ndash;&ndash;which is not&ndash;&ndash;my
own.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>Marya looked at him for a long while. Suddenly
she flung the pistol into a corner, threw back her head
while peal on peal of laughter rang out in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thief,&rdquo; she said, fairly holding her slender sides
between gemmed fingers: &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;Just a Levantine thief,
after all! Not a thing to shoot. Not a man. No!
But a giant cockroach from the tropics. Ugh! Too
large to place one&rsquo;s foot upon!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came leisurely forward, halted, inspected him
with laughing insolence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the others&ndash;&ndash;Kastner, Sondheim&ndash;&ndash;and the other
vermin? You were quite right. Why should I kill
them&ndash;&ndash;merely because to-day a real man died? What
if they are the same species of vermin that slew Vanya
Tchernov? They are not men to pay for it. My pistol
could not make a dead man out of a live louse! No,
you are quite correct. You know your own kind. It
would be no compliment to Vanya if I should give these
vermin the death that real men die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puma stood close to the door, furtively passing a
thick tongue over his dry, blanched lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will not interfere?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders: one was bare with the
torn sleeve dangling. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said wearily. &ldquo;Run
home, painted pig. After all, the world is mostly
swine.... I, too, it seems&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She half raised
her arms, but the gesture failed, and she stood thinking
again and staring at the curtained window. She did
not hear him leave.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>
<p>In the strange, springlike weather which prevailed
during the last days of January, Vanya was buried
under skies as fleecy blue as April&rsquo;s, and Marya
Lanois went back to the studio apartment where she
and Vanya had lived together. And here, alone, in the
first month of the new year, she picked up again the
ravelled threads of life, undecided whether to untangle
them or to cut them short and move on once more to
further misadventure; or to Vanya; or somewhere&ndash;&ndash;or
perhaps nowhere. So, pending some decision, she left
her pistol loaded.</p>
<p>Afternoon sunshine poured into the studio between
antique silken curtains, now drawn wide to the outer
day for the first time since these two young people had
established for themselves a habitation.</p>
<p>And what, heretofore, even the lighted mosque-lamps
had scarcely half revealed, now lay exposed to outer
air and daylight, gilded by the sun&ndash;&ndash;cabinets and chests
of ancient lacquer; deep-toned carpets in which slumbered
jewelled fires of Asia; carved gods from the East,
crusted with soft gold; and tapestries of silk shot with
amethyst and saffron, centred by dragons and guarded
by the burning pearl.</p>
<p>Over all these, and the great mosque lantern drooping
from above, the false-spring sunshine fell; and
through every open window flowed soft, deceptive winds,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
fluttering the leaves of music on the piano, stirring the
clustered sheafs of growing jonquils and narcissus, so
that they swayed in their Chinese bowls.</p>
<p>Marya, in black, arranged her tiger-ruddy hair before
an ancient grotesquerie set with a reflecting glass
in which, on some days, one could see the form of the
Lord Buddha, though none could ever tell from whence
the image came.</p>
<p>Where Vanya had left his music opened on the piano
rack, the sacred pages now stirred slightly as the soft
wind blew; and scented bells of Frisia swayed and bowed
around a bowl where gold-fish glowed.</p>
<p>Marya, at the piano, reading at sight from his inked
manuscript, came presently to the end of what was
scored there&ndash;&ndash;merely the first sketch for a little spring
song.</p>
<p>Some day she would finish it as part of a new debt&ndash;&ndash;new
obligations she had now assumed in the slowly increasing
light of new beliefs.</p>
<p>As she laid Vanya&rsquo;s last manuscript aside, under it
she discovered one of her own&ndash;&ndash;a cynical, ribald,
pencilled parody which she remembered she had
scribbled there in an access of malicious perversity.</p>
<p>As though curious to sound the obscurer depths of
what she had been when this jeering cynicism expressed
her mood, she began to read from her score and words,
playing and intoning:</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>The vicious irony of the atrocious parody&ndash;&ndash;words
and music&ndash;&ndash;died out in the sunny silence: for a few
moments the girl sat staring at the scored page; then
she leaned forward, and, taking the manuscript in both
hands, tore it into pieces.</p>
<p>She was still occupied in destroying the unclean thing
when a servant appeared, and in subdued voice announced
Palla and Ilse.</p>
<p>They came in as Marya swept the tattered scraps of
paper into an incense-bowl, dropped a lighted match
upon them, and set the ancient bronze vessel on the
sill of the open window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of my vileness I am burning,&rdquo; she said, coming
forward and kissing Ilse on both cheeks.</p>
<p>Then, looking Palla steadily in the eyes, she bent forward
and touched her lips with her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nechevo,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the thing that dwelt within
me for a time has continued on its way to hell, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the pale girl by both hands: &ldquo;Do you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Palla kissed her.</p>
<p>When they were seated: &ldquo;What religious order
would be likely to accept me?&rdquo; she asked serenely. And
answered her own question: &ldquo;None would tolerate me&ndash;&ndash;no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
order with its rigid systems of inquiry and its
merciless investigations.... And yet&ndash;&ndash;I wonder.... Perhaps,
as a lay-sister in some missionary
order&ndash;&ndash;where few care to serve&ndash;&ndash;where life resembles
death as one twin the other.... I don&rsquo;t know: I
wonder, Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla asked her in a low voice if she had seen the
afternoon paper. Marya did not reply at once; but
presently over her face a hot rose-glow spread and
deepened. Then, after a silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper mentioned me as Vanya&rsquo;s wife. Is that
what you mean? Yes; I told them that.... It
made no difference, for they would have discovered it
anyway. And I scarcely know why I made Vanya lie
about it to you all;&ndash;&ndash;why I wished people to think
otherwise.... Because I have been married to
Vanya since the beginning.... And I can not
explain why I have not told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She touched a rosebud in the vase that stood beside
her, broke the stem absently, and sat examining it in
silence. And, after a few moments:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a child I was too imaginative.... We do
not change&ndash;&ndash;we women. Married, unmarried, too wise,
or too innocent, we remain what we were when our
mothers bore us.... Whatever we do, we never
change within: we remain, in our souls, what we first
were. And unaltered we die.... In morgue or
prison or Potter&rsquo;s Field, where lies a dead female thing
in a tattered skirt, there, hidden somewhere under rag
and skin and bone, lies a dead girl-child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid the unopened rosebud on Palla&rsquo;s knees; her
preoccupied gaze wandered around that silent, sunlit
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have taken my pistol,&rdquo; she said softly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
&ldquo;and I could have killed a few among those whose
doctrines at last slew Vanya.... Or I could have
killed myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and her remote gaze came back to fix
itself on Palla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, somehow, I think that Vanya would grieve....
And he has grieved enough. Do you think so,
Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse said thoughtfully: &ldquo;There is always enough
death on earth. And to live honestly, and love undauntedly,
and serve humanity with a clean heart is
the most certain way to help the slaying of that thing
which murdered Vanya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla gazed at Marya, profoundly preoccupied by
the astounding revelation that she had been Vanya&rsquo;s
legal wife; and in her brown eyes the stunned wonder
of it still remained, nor could she seem to think of anything
except of that amazing fact.</p>
<p>When they stood up to take leave of Marya, the rosebud
dropped from Palla&rsquo;s lap, and Marya picked it
up and offered it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should open,&rdquo; she said, her strange smile glimmering.
&ldquo;Cold water and a little salt, my Palla&ndash;&ndash;that
is all rosebuds need&ndash;&ndash;that is all we women need&ndash;&ndash;a
little water to cool and freshen us; a little salt for all
the doubtful worldly knowledge we imbibe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took Palla&rsquo;s hands and bent her lips to them,
then lifted her tawny head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do words matter? <i>Slava, slava</i>, under the
moon! Words are but symbols of needs&ndash;&ndash;your need
and Ilse&rsquo;s and mine&ndash;&ndash;and Jack&rsquo;s and Vanya&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;and the
master-word differs as differ our several needs. And
if I say Christ and Buddha and I are one, let me so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
believe, if that be my need. Or if, from some high
minarette, I lift my voice proclaiming the unity of
God!&ndash;&ndash;or if I confess the Trinity!&ndash;&ndash;or if, for me, the
god-fire smoulders only within my own accepted soul&ndash;&ndash;what
does it matter? Slava, slava&ndash;&ndash;the word and the
need spell Love&ndash;&ndash;whatever the deed, Palla&ndash;&ndash;my Palla!&ndash;&ndash;whatever
the deed, and despite it.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>As they came, together, to Palla&rsquo;s house and entered
the empty drawing-room, Ilse said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In mysticism there seems to be no reasoning&ndash;&ndash;nothing
definite save only an occult and overwhelming restlessness....
Marya may take the veil ... or
nurse lepers ... or she may become a famous
courtesan.... I do not mean it cruelly. But, in
the mystic, the spiritual, the intellectual and the physical
seem to be interchangeable, and become gradually
indistinguishable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a frightful analysis,&rdquo; murmured Palla. A
little shiver passed over her and she laid the rosebud
against her lips.</p>
<p>Ilse said: &ldquo;Marya is right: love is the world&rsquo;s overwhelming
need. The way to love is to serve; and if
we serve we must renounce something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They locked arms and began to pace the empty room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I renounce?&rdquo; asked Palla faintly.</p>
<p>Ilse smiled that wise, wholesome smile of hers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you renounce your own omniscience, darling,&rdquo;
she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think myself omniscient,&rdquo; retorted the girl,
colouring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Well, darling, from where then do you derive
your authority to cancel the credentials of the Most
High?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what authority except your own omniscience do
you so confidently preach the non-existence of omnipotence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla turned her flushed face in sensitive astonishment
under the gentle mockery.</p>
<p>Ilse said: &ldquo;Love has many names; and so has God.
And all are good. If, to you, God means that little
flame within you, then that is good. And so, to others,
according to their needs.... And it is the same
with love.... So, if for the man you love, love
can be written only as a phrase&ndash;&ndash;if the word love be
only one element in a trinity of which the other two
are Law and Wedlock&ndash;&ndash;does it really matter, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I&ndash;&ndash;I am to renounce my&ndash;&ndash;creed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilse shook her head: &ldquo;Who cares? The years develop
and change everything&ndash;&ndash;even creeds. Do you
think your lover would care whether, at twenty-odd, you
worship the flaming godhead itself, or whether you
guard in spirit that lost spark from it which has become
entangled with your soul?&ndash;&ndash;whether you really do believe
the man-made law that licenses your mating; or
whether you reject it as a silly superstition? To a
business man, convention is merely a safe procedure
which, ignored, causes disaster&ndash;&ndash;he knows that whenever
he ignores it&ndash;&ndash;as when he drives a car bearing no
license; and the police stop him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never expected to hear this from you, Ilse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are unmarried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stared at her: &ldquo;Did you <i>marry</i> Jack?&rdquo;
she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. In the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ilse!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; her mouth quivered and she bent her head
and placed her hand on Ilse&rsquo;s arm for guidance, because
the starting tears were blinding her now. And at last
she found her voice: &ldquo;I meant I am so thankful&ndash;&ndash;darling&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
been a&ndash;&ndash;a nightmare&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been one to me if I had refused him.
Except that Jack wished it, I did not care.... But
I have lately learned&ndash;&ndash;some things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you consented because he wished it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Is not that our law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you so construe the Law of Love and Service?
Does it permit us to seek protection under false pretences;
to say yes when we mean no; to kneel before a
God we do not believe in; to accept immunity under a
law we do not believe in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all this concerned only one&rsquo;s self, then, no! Or,
if the man believed as we do, no! But even then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
she shook her head slowly, &ldquo;unless <i>all</i> agree, it is unfair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is unfair if you have a baby. Isn&rsquo;t it, darling?
Isn&rsquo;t it unfair and tyrannical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that a child should not arbitrarily be
placed by its parents at what it might later consider a
disadvantage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I mean just that. Do you know, Palla,
what Jack once said of us? He said&ndash;&ndash;rather brutally,
I thought&ndash;&ndash;that you and I were immaturely un-moral
and pitiably unbaked; and that the best thing for both
of us was to marry and have a few children before we
tried to do any more independent thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s reply was: &ldquo;He was such a dear!&rdquo; But what
she said did not seem absurd to either of them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></div>
<p>Ilse added: &ldquo;You know yourself, darling, what a
relief it was to you to learn that I had married Jack.
I think you even said something like, &lsquo;Thank God,&rsquo; when
you were choking back the tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla flushed brightly: &ldquo;I meant&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; but her voice
ended in a sob. Then, all of a sudden, she broke down&ndash;&ndash;went
all to pieces there in the dim and empty little
drawing-room&ndash;&ndash;down on her knees, clinging to Ilse&rsquo;s
skirts....</p>
<p>She wished to go to her room alone; and so Ilse,
watching her climb the stairs as though they led to
some dread calvary, opened the front door and went
her lonely way, drawing the mourning veil around her
face and throat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>
<p>Leila Vance, lunching with Elorn Sharrow at
the Ritz, spoke of Estridge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seem to be so many of these well-born
men who marry women we never heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we ought to have heard of them,&rdquo; suggested
Elorn, smilingly. &ldquo;The trouble may lie with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does, dear. But it&rsquo;s something we can&rsquo;t help,
unless we change radically. Because we don&rsquo;t stand the
chance we once did. We never have been as attractive
to men as the other sort. But once men thought they
couldn&rsquo;t marry the other sort. Now they think they
can. And they do if they have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other sort?&rdquo; asked Elorn, not entirely understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sort of girl who ignores the customs which
make us what we are. We don&rsquo;t stand a chance with
professional women any more. We don&rsquo;t compare in
interest to girls who are arbiters of their own destinies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the stage as an illustration. Once the popularity
of women who made it their profession was due
partly to glamour, partly because that art drew to it
and concentrated the very best-looking among us. But
it&rsquo;s something else now that attracts men; it&rsquo;s the attraction
of women who are doing something&ndash;&ndash;clever,
experienced, interesting, girls who know how to take
care of themselves and who are not afraid to give to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
men a frank and gay companionship outside those
conventional limits which circumscribe us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elorn nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; said Leila. &ldquo;The independent professional
girl to-day, whatever art or business engages
her, is the paramount attraction to men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few do sneak back to us after a jolly caper in the
open&ndash;&ndash;a few timid ones, or snobs of sorts&ndash;&ndash;thrifty,
perhaps, or otherwise material, or cautious. But that&rsquo;s
about all we get as husbands in these devilish days of
general feminine <i>bouleversement</i>. And it&rsquo;s a sad and
instructive fact, Elorn. But there seems to be nothing
to do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elorn said musingly: &ldquo;The main thing seems to be
that men admire a girl&rsquo;s effort to get somewhere&ndash;&ndash;when
she happens to be good-looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cynical fact, dear; they certainly do. And
now that they realise they have to marry these girls
if they want them&ndash;&ndash;why, they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elorn dissected her ice. &ldquo;You know Stanley
Wardner,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortimer Wardner&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elorn nodded. &ldquo;He became a queer kind of sculptor.
I think it is called a Concentrationist. Well, he&rsquo;s concentrated
for life, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom did he marry?&rdquo; asked Leila, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl named Questa Terrett. You never heard of
her, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And I can imagine the moans and groans of
the Mortimer Wardners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard so. She lives&ndash;&ndash;<i>they</i> live now, together,
in Abdingdon Square, where she possesses a studio and
nearly a dozen West Highland terriers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else does she do?&rdquo; inquired Leila, still laughing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She writes cleverly when she needs an income; otherwise,
she produces obscure poems with malice aforethought,
and laughs in her sleeve, they say, when the
precious-minded rave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leila reverted to Estridge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea he was married,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Palla
Dumont introduced his widow to me the other day&ndash;&ndash;a
most superb and beautiful creature. But, oh dear I&ndash;&ndash;can
you fancy her having once served as a girl-soldier
in the Russian Battalion of Death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slightest shadow crossed Elorn&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; added Leila, following quite innocently
her trend of thought, &ldquo;Helen Shotwell tells me that her
son is going back to the army if he can secure a
commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe so,&rdquo; said Elorn serenely.</p>
<p>Leila went on: &ldquo;I fancy there&rsquo;ll be a lot of them.
A taste of service seems to spoil most young men for a
piping career of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cares nothing for his business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real estate. He is with my father, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I remember&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She suddenly seemed
to recollect something else, also&ndash;&ndash;not, perhaps, quite
certain of it, but instinctively playing safe. So she
refrained from saying anything about this young man&rsquo;s
recent devotion to her friend, Palla Dumont, although
that was the subject which she had intended to introduce.</p>
<p>And, smiling to herself, she thought it a close call,
because she had meant to ask Elorn whether she knew
why the Shotwell boy had so entirely deserted her little
friend Palla.</p>
<p>The Shotwell boy himself happened to be involved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
at that very moment, in matters concerning a friend
of Mrs. Vance&rsquo;s little friend Palla&ndash;&ndash;in fact, he had
been trying, for the last half hour, to find this friend
of Palla&rsquo;s on the telephone. The friend in question
was Alonzo D. Pawling. And he was being vigorously
paged at the Hotel Rajah.</p>
<p>As for Jim, he remained seated in the private office
of Angelo Puma, whither he had been summoned in professional
capacity by one Skidder, the same being Elmer,
and partner of the Puma aforesaid.</p>
<p>The door was locked; the room in disorder. Safe,
letter-files, cupboards, desks had been torn open and
their contents littered the place.</p>
<p>Skidder, in an agony of perspiring fright, kept
running about the room like a distracted squirrel. Jim
watched him, darkly preoccupied with other things, including
the whereabouts of Mr. Pawling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say,&rdquo; he said to Skidder, &ldquo;that Mr. Pawling
will confirm what you have told me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John D. Pawling knows damn well I own this plant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but that isn&rsquo;t sufficient.
I can only repeat to you that there is no
point in calling me in at present. You have no legal
right to offer this property for sale. It belongs, apparently,
to the creditors of your firm. What you
require first of all is a lawyer&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a lawyer and I don&rsquo;t want publicity
before I get something out of this dirty mess that
scoundrel left behind!&rdquo; cried Skidder, snapping his eyes
like mad and swinging his arms. &ldquo;I got to get something,
haven&rsquo;t I? Isn&rsquo;t this property mine? Can&rsquo;t I
sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently not, under the terms of your agreement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
with Puma,&rdquo; replied Jim, wearily. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m willing
to hear what Mr. Pawling has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to tell me, Puma fixed it so I&rsquo;m stuck
with all his debts? You mean to say my own personal
property is subject to seizure to satisfy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do mean just that, Mr. Skidder. But
I&rsquo;m not a lawyer&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I want to get something for myself before
I let loose any lawyers on the premises! I&rsquo;ll make
it all right with you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of the question. We wouldn&rsquo;t touch the
property&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a quarter of its value in spot cash! I&rsquo;ll
give you ten thousand to put it through to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you understand that what you suggest
would amount to collusion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I propose is to get a slice of what&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;
yelled Skidder, fairly dancing with fury. &ldquo;D&rsquo;yeh think
I&rsquo;m going to let that crooked wop, Puma, do this to
me just like that! D&rsquo;yeh think he&rsquo;s going to get away
with all my money and all Pawling&rsquo;s money and leave
me planted on my neck while about a million other guys
come and sell me out and fill their pants pockets with
what&rsquo;s mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim said: &ldquo;If Mr. Pawling is the very rich man you
say he is, he&rsquo;s not going to let the defalcation of this
fellow, Puma, destroy such a paying property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, I don&rsquo;t want him to buy it in for himself
and freeze me out! I can&rsquo;t stop him, either; Puma&rsquo;s got
all my money except what&rsquo;s in this parcel. And you
betcha life I hang onto this, creditors or no creditors,
and Pawling to the contrary! He knows damn well
it belongs to me. Try him again at the Rajah&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re paging him. I left the number. But I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
tell you the proper thing for you to do is to go to a
lawyer, and then to the police,&rdquo; repeated Jim. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing else to do. This fellow, Puma, may have run
for the Mexican border, or he may still be in the United
States. Without a passport he couldn&rsquo;t very easily
get on any trans-Atlantic boat or any South American
boat either. The proper procedure is to notify the
police&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix on the police!&rdquo; shouted Skidder. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll start
the land-slide, and the whole shooting-match will go.
I want <i>this</i> property. If the papers show it&rsquo;s subject
to the firm&rsquo;s liabilities, then that dirty skunk altered
the thing. It&rsquo;s forgery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was fool enough to lump this parcel in with
our assets. Not me. It&rsquo;s forgery; that&rsquo;s what it is,
and this parcel belongs to me, privately&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See an attorney,&rdquo; repeated Jim patiently. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t keep a thing like this out of the papers, Mr.
Skidder. Why, here&rsquo;s a man, Angelo Puma, who
pounces on every convertible asset of his firm, stuffs
a valise full of real money, and beats it for parts unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a matter for the police. You can&rsquo;t hope to
hide it for more than a day or two longer. Your firm
is bankrupt through the rascality of a partner. He&rsquo;s
gone with all the money he could scrape together. He
converted everything into cash; he lied, swindled, stole,
and skipped. And what he didn&rsquo;t take must remain to
satisfy the firm&rsquo;s creditors. You can&rsquo;t conceal conditions,
slyly pocket what Puma has left and then call
in an attorney. That&rsquo;s criminal. You have your contracts
to fulfil; you have a studio full of people whose
salaries are nearly due; you have running expenses;
you have notes to meet; you have obligations to face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
when a dozen or so contractors for your new theatre
come to you on Saturday&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that&rsquo;s all up to me?&rdquo; shrieked Skidder,
squinting horribly at a framed photograph of Puma.
And suddenly he ran at it and hurled it to the floor
and began to kick it about with strange, provincial
maledictions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dern yeh, yeh poor blimgasted thing! I&rsquo;ll skin
yeh, yeh dumb-faced, ring-boned, two-edged son-of-a-skunk!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone&rsquo;s clamour silenced him. Jim answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Oh, long-distance. All right.&rdquo; And he
waited. Then, again: &ldquo;Who wants him?... Yes,
he&rsquo;s here in the office, now.... Yes, he&rsquo;ll come to
the &rsquo;phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to Skidder: &ldquo;Shadow Hill wants to speak to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go. By God, if this thing is out!&ndash;&ndash;Who the
hell is it wants to speak to me? Wait! Maybe it&rsquo;s
Alonzo D. Pawling!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I inquire?&rdquo; And he asked for further information
over the wire. Then, presently, and turning
again to Skidder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come to the wire. It seems to be the
Chief of Police who wants you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skidder&rsquo;s unhealthy skin became ghastly. He came
over and took the instrument:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye want, Chief? Sure it&rsquo;s me, Elmer....
Hey? Who? Alonzo D. Pawling? My God,
is he dead? Took <i>pizen</i>! W-what for! He&rsquo;s a rich
man, ain&rsquo;t he?... Speculated?... You say
he took the bank&rsquo;s funds? Trust funds? What!&rdquo;
he screeched&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;put &rsquo;em into <i>my</i> company! He&rsquo;s a liar!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
... I don&rsquo;t care what letters he left!...
Well, all right then. Sure, I&rsquo;ll get a lawyer&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to hold that wire!&rdquo; cut in Jim; and took
the receiver from Skidder&rsquo;s shaking fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Shadow Hill Trust Company insolvent?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;You say that the bank closed its doors this
morning? Have you any idea of its condition?
Looted? Is it entirely cleaned out? Is there no chance
for depositors? I wish to inquire about the trust funds,
bonds and other investments belonging to a friend of
mine, Miss Dumont.... Yes, I&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned a troubled and sombre gaze toward
Skidder, who sat there pasty-faced, with sagging jaw,
staring back at him. And presently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... Yes, this is Mr. Shotwell, a friend of
Miss Dumont.... Yes.... Yes.... Yes....
I see.... Yes, I shall try to communicate
with her immediately.... Yes, I suppose the news
will be published in the evening papers.... Certainly....
Yes, I have no doubt that she will go at
once to Shadow Hill.... Thank you.... Yes,
it does seem rather hopeless.... I&rsquo;ll try to find
her and break it to her.... Thank you. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver, took his hat and coat, his
eyes fixed absently on Skidder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better beat it to your attorney,&rdquo; he remarked,
and went out.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He could not find Palla. She was not at the Red
Cross, not at the canteen, not at the new Hostess House.</p>
<p>He telephoned Ilse for information, but she was not
at home.</p>
<p>Twice he called at Palla&rsquo;s house, leaving a message
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
the last time that she should telephone him at the club
on her arrival.</p>
<p>He went to the club and waited there, trying to read.
At a quarter to six o&rsquo;clock no message from her had
come.</p>
<p>Again he telephoned Ilse; she had not returned. He
even telephoned to Marya, loath to disturb her; but
she, also, was not at home.</p>
<p>The chances that he could break the news to Palla
before she read it in the evening paper were becoming
negligible. He had done his best to forestall them. But
at six the evening papers arrived at the club. And in
every one of them was an account of the defalcation
and suicide of the Honorable Alonzo D. Pawling, president
of the Shadow Hill Trust Company. But nothing
yet concerning the defalcation and disappearance
of Angelo Puma.</p>
<p>Jim had no inclination to eat, but he tried to at
seven-thirty, still waiting and hoping for a message
from Palla.</p>
<p>He tried her house again about half past eight. This
time the maid answered that Miss Dumont had telephoned
from down town that she would dine out and
go afterward to the Combat Club. And that if Mr.
Shotwell desired to see her he should call at her house
after ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>So Jim hastened to the cloak-room, got his hat and
coat, found the starter, secured a taxi, bought an evening
paper and stuffed it into his pocket, and started
out to find Palla at the Combat Club. For it seemed evident
to him that she had not yet read the evening paper;
and he hoped he might yet encounter her in time to prepare
her for news which, according to the newspapers,
appeared even blacker than he had supposed it might be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>
<p>As he left the taxi in front of the dirty brick archway
and flight of steps leading to the hall, where
he expected to find Palla, he noticed a small
crowd of wrangling foreigners gathered there&ndash;&ndash;men
and women&ndash;&ndash;and a policeman posted near, calm and
indifferent, juggling his club at the end of its leather
thong.</p>
<p>Jim paused to inquire if there had been any trouble
there that evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the policeman, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s two talking-clubs
that chew the rag in that joint. It&rsquo;s the Reds&rsquo;
night, but wan o&rsquo; the ladies of the other club showed
up&ndash;&ndash;Miss Dumont&ndash;&ndash;and the Reds yonder was all for
chasing her out. So we run in a couple of &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;that
feller Sondheim and another called Bromberg. They&rsquo;re
wanted, anyhow, in Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a meeting inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. The young lady went in to settle it peaceful
like; and she&rsquo;s inside now jawin&rsquo; at them Reds to
beat a pink tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you apprehend any violence?&rdquo; asked Jim uneasily.</p>
<p>The policeman juggled his club and eyed him. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;guess&ndash;&ndash;not,&rdquo;
he drawled. And, to the jabbering,
wrangling crowd on pavement and steps: &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;Hey, you!
Go in or stay out, one or the other, now! Step lively;
you&rsquo;re blockin&rsquo; the sidewalk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A number of people mounted the steps and went in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
with Jim. As the doors to the hall opened, a flare of
smoky light struck him, and he pushed his way into the
hall, where a restless, murmuring audience, some seated,
others standing, was watching a number of men and
women on the rostrum.</p>
<p>There seemed to be more wrangling going on there&ndash;&ndash;knots
of people disputing and apparently quite oblivious
of the audience.</p>
<p>And almost immediately he caught sight of Palla on
the platform. But even before he could take a step
forward in the crowded aisle, he saw her force her way
out of an excited group of people and come to the
edge of the platform, lifting a slim hand for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put her out!&rdquo; shouted some man&rsquo;s voice. A dozen
other voices bawled out incoherencies; Palla waited;
and after a moment or two there were no further interruptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let me say what I have to say,&rdquo; she said in that
shy and gentle way she had when facing hostile listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak louder!&rdquo; yelled a young man. &ldquo;Come on,
silk-stockings!&ndash;&ndash;spit it out and go home to mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Her rejoinder was so odd and unexpected that stillness
settled over the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all I can do,&rdquo; she added, in an even, colourless
voice, &ldquo;is to go home. And I shall do that after I have
said what I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment there was a commotion in the rear
of the hall. A dozen policemen filed into the place,
pushing their way right and left and ranging themselves
along the wall. Their officer came into the aisle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any disorder in this place to-night, I&rsquo;ll
run in the whole bunch o&rsquo; ye!&rdquo; he said calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Hit out, little girl!&rdquo; cried the young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
man who had interrupted before. &ldquo;We gotta lot of
business to fix up after you&rsquo;ve gone to bed, so get busy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, also, have some business to fix up,&rdquo; she said in
the same sweet, emotionless voice, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;business of setting
myself right by admitting that I have been wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, on this spot where I am standing, I have
spoken against the old order of things. I have said
that there is no law excepting only the law of Love and
Service. I have said that there is no God other than
the deathless germ of deity within each one of us. I
have said that the conventions and beliefs and usages
and customs of civilisation were old, outworn, and
tyrannical; and that there was no need to regard them
or to obey the arbitrary laws based on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, I have preached disorder while attempting
to combat it: I have preached revolution while
counselling peace; I have preached bigotry where I have
demanded toleration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For there is no worse bigot than the free-thinker
who demands that the world subscribe to his creed;
no tyrant like the under-dog when he becomes the upper
one; no autocracy to compare with mob rule!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can not obtain freedom for all by imposing
that creed upon anybody by the violence of revolutionary
ukase!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can not wreck any edifice until all who enjoy
ownership in it agree to its demolition. You can not
build for all unless each voluntarily comes forward to
aid with stone and mortar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anarchy leaves the majority roofless. What is the
use of saying, &lsquo;Let them perish&rsquo;? What is the use of
trying to rebuild the world that way? You can&rsquo;t do
it, even if you set fire to the world and start your endless
war of human murder.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If you were the majority you would not need to do
it. But you are the minority, and there are too many
against you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only by infinite pains and patience can you alter
the social structure to better it. Cautious and wary
replacement is the only method, not exploding a mine
beneath the keystone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world has won out from barbarism so far. It
must continue to emerge by degrees. And if beliefs and
laws and customs be obsolete, only by general agreement
may they be modified without danger to all. Not
the violent revolt of one or a dozen or a thousand can
alter what has, so far, nourished and sustained civilisation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the Prussian belief. Bolshevism was sired
by Karl Marx and was hatched out in the shaggy
gloom of the Prussian wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not belong anywhere else; it does not belong
on the plains of Russia or in her forests or on her
mountains. It is a Prussian thing&ndash;&ndash;a misbegotten
monster born of a vile and decadent race,&ndash;&ndash;a horrible
parasite, like that one which carries typhus, infects
as it spreads from the degraded race that hatched it,
crawling from country to country and leaving behind
it dead minds, dead hearts, dead souls, and rotting
flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For order and disorder can not both reign paramount
on this planet! The one shall slay the other.
And Bolshevism is disorder&ndash;&ndash;a violent and tyrannical
and autocratic attempt to utterly destroy the vast
majority for the benefit of the microscopic minority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can not do it, you Terrorists! Prussia tried
terrorism on the world. Where is she to-day? You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
can not teach by frightfulness. You can not scare
beliefs out of anybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Method, order, education&ndash;&ndash;there is no other chance
for any propagandist to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have stood here night after night proclaiming that
my personal conception of right and wrong, of truth
and falsehood, of law and morals was the only intelligent
one, and that I should ignore and disregard any
other opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I preached was Bolshevism! And I was such
a fool I didn&rsquo;t know it. But that&rsquo;s what I preached.
For it is an incitement to disorder to proclaim one&rsquo;s
self above obedience to what has been established as
a law to govern all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an insidious counsel to violence, revolution,
Bolshevism and utter anarchy to say to people that
they should disregard any law formed by all for the
common weal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the marriage law seems unnecessary, unjust, then
only by common consent can it be altered; and until
it is altered, any who disregard it strike at civilisation!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the laws governing capital and labour seem cruel,
stupid, tyrannical, only by general consent can they
be altered safely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You of the Bolsheviki can not come among us dripping
with human blood, showing us your fangs, and
expect from us anything except a fusillade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your propaganda, also, is not human. It is
Prussian. Do you suppose, you foreign-born, that you
can come here among this free people and begin your
operations by cursing our laws and institutions and
telling us we are not free?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we tolerate you, do you suppose we don&rsquo;t
know that in most of the larger cities there are now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
organised Soviets, similar to those in Russia, that
anarchists are now conducting schools, and that the
radical propaganda which has taken on new life since
the signing of the armistice is gaining headway in those
parts of the country where there are large foreign-born
populations?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose we don&rsquo;t know Prussianism when
we see it, after these last four years?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose we have not read the <i>Staats-Zeitung</i>
editorial of December 8, which in part was as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hundreds of thousands of our boys are standing
now over there in the old homeland, which for nineteen
months was enemy country and is that still, but which,
as President Wilson promised, will soon be a land of
peace again, rich in diligent work, rich in true and
good people.... As the whole happy life of
this blessed region presents a picture to the spectator,
it is to be wondered whether his (the American soldier&rsquo;s)
memory will awaken on what he read of this country
(Germany) at home long ago, whether he will feel a
slight blush of shame in his cheeks and anger for those
who, not from their own knowledge but from doubtful
sources, branded a whole great people, 70,000,000, as
barbarians, huns, murderers of children and church
robbers. And whether he (the American soldier) will
at the same time make a pledge in his heart to combat
those lies and rumours when he is back home again, and
to tell the truth about those (the Germans) living behind
those mountains.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palla&rsquo;s face flushed and she came close to the edge of
the platform:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been warned that if I came here to-night
I&rsquo;d have trouble. The anonymous writers who send me
letters talk about bombs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine because you murdered Vanya
Tchernov in Philadelphia the other day that you can
frighten anybody dumb?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re
dazed and scared and bewildered by finding yourselves
suddenly in the open world after all those lurking years
in hiding. As a forest wolf, his eyes dazzled by the
sun, runs blindly across a field of new mown hay, dodging
where there is nothing to dodge, leaping over
shadows, so you, emerging from darkness, start out
across the fertile world, the sun of civilisation blinding
you so that you run as though stupefied and frightened,
shying at straws, dodging zephyrs, leaping a pool
of dew as though it were the Volga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you afraid of? You have nothing to
fear except yourselves out here in the sunny open!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold your enemies&ndash;&ndash;yourselves!&ndash;&ndash;selfish, defiant,
full of false council, of envy, of cowardice, of treachery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For there would be no sorrow, no injustice in the
world if we&ndash;&ndash;each one of us&ndash;&ndash;were true to our better
selves! You know it! You can not come out of darkness
and range the open world like wolves! Civilisation
will kill you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can come out of your long twilight bearing
yourselves like men&ndash;&ndash;and find, by God&rsquo;s grace, that
you <i>are</i> men!&ndash;&ndash;that you are fashioned like other men
to stand upright in the light without blinking and slinking
and dodging into cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the haymakers will not climb and stone you; the
herds will not stampede; no watch-dogs of civilisation
will attack you if you come out into the fields looking
like men, behaving like men, asking to share the world&rsquo;s
burdens like men, and like men giving brain and brawn
to make more pleasant and secure the only spot in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
solar system dedicated by the Most High to the development
of mankind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a dead silence in the place.</p>
<p>Palla slowly lifted her head and raised her right
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire,&rdquo; she said in a low, grave voice, &ldquo;to acknowledge
here my belief in law, in order, and in a divine,
creative, and responsible wisdom. And in ultimate
continuation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away as a demonstration began, and Jim
saw her putting on her coat. There was some scattering
applause, but considerable disorder where men in
the audience began to harangue each other and shake
dirty fingers under one another&rsquo;s noses. Two personal
encounters and one hair-pulling were checked by bored
policemen: a girl got up and began to shout that she
was a striking garment worker and that she had neither
money, time, nor inclination to wait until some amateur
silk-stocking felt like raising her wages.</p>
<p>On the platform Karl Kastner had come forward,
and his icy, incisive, menacing voice cut the growing
tumult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haff heard with patience thiss so silly prattle
of a rich young girl&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Now it is a poor
man who speaks to you out of a heart full of bitterness
against this law and order which you haff heard
so highly praised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this much-praised law and order it hass to-night
assassinated free speech; it has arrested our comrades,
Nathan Bromberg and Max Sondheim; it hass
fill our hall with policemen. And I wonder if there iss,
perhaps, a little too much law and order in the world,
und iff <i>vielleicht</i>, there may be too many policemen as
vell as capitalist-little-girls in thiss hall.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Und, sometimes, too, I am wondering why iss it ve
do not kill a few&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; interrupted the sergeant of police,
striding down the aisle. &ldquo;Come on, now, Karl; you
done it that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An angry roar arose all around him; he nodded to
his men:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run in any cut-ups,&rdquo; he said briefly; climbed up
to the rostrum, and laid his hand on Kastner&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>At the same moment a stunning explosion shook the
place and plunged it into darkness. Out of the smoke-choked
blackness burst an uproar of shrieks and
screams; plaster and glass fell everywhere; police
whistles sounded; a frantic, struggling mass of
humanity fought for escape.</p>
<p>As Jim reeled out into the lobby, he saw Palla leaning
against the wall, with blood on her face.</p>
<p>Before the first of the trampling horde emerged he
had caught her by the arm and had led her down the
steps to the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve blown up the&ndash;&ndash;the place,&rdquo; she stammered,
wiping her face with her gloved hand in a dazed sort
of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you badly hurt?&rdquo; he asked unsteadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had led her as far as the avenue, now echoing
with the clang of fire engines and the police patrol.
And out of the darkness, from everywhere, swarmed the
crowd that only a great city can conjure instantly and
from nowhere.</p>
<p>Blood ran down her face from a cut over her temple.
A tiny triangular bit of glass still glittered in the
wound; and he removed it and gave her his handkerchief.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Was Ilse there, too?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Nobody went to-night except myself....
Why were you there, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in God&rsquo;s name did <i>you</i> go there all alone
among those Reds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head wearily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to.... What a horrible thing to happen!...
I am so tired, Jim. Could you get me
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found a taxi nearer Broadway and directed the
driver to stop at a drug-store. Here he insisted that
the tiny cut on Palla&rsquo;s temple be properly attended to.
But it proved a simple matter; there was no glass in it,
and the bleeding ceased before they reached her house.</p>
<p>At the door he took leave of her, deeming it no time
to subject her to any further shock that night; but
she retained her hold on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come in, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you were tired; and you&rsquo;ve had a terrible
shock&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why I need you,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.
Then, looking up at him with a pale smile: &ldquo;I want
you&ndash;&ndash;just once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went in together. Her maid, hearing the opening
door, appeared and took her away; and Jim turned
into the living-room. A lighted lamp on the piano
illuminated his own framed photograph&ndash;&ndash;that was the
first thing he noticed&ndash;&ndash;the portrait of himself in uniform,
flanked on either side by little vases full of blue
forget-me-nots.</p>
<p>He started to lift one to his face, but reaction had
set in and his hands were shaking. And he turned away
and stood staring into the empty fireplace, passionately
possessed once more by the eternal witchery of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
young girl, and under the spell again of the enchanted
place wherein she dwelt.</p>
<p>The very air breathed her magic; every familiar
object seemed to be stealthily conspiring in the subdued
light to reaccomplish his subjection.</p>
<p>Her maid appeared to say that Miss Dumont would
be ready in a few minutes. She came, presently, in
a clinging chamber-gown&ndash;&ndash;a pale golden affair with
misty touches of lace.</p>
<p>He arranged cushions for her: she lighted a cigarette
for him; and he sank down beside her in the old place.</p>
<p>Both were still a little shaken. He said that he believed
the explosion had come from the outside, and
that the principal damage had been done next door,
in Mr. Puma&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>She nodded assent, listlessly, evidently preoccupied
with something else.</p>
<p>After a few moments she looked up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the second day of February,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Within the last month Jack Estridge died, and Vanya
died.... To-day another man died&ndash;&ndash;a man I have
known from childhood.... His name was Pawling.
And his death has ruined me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&ndash;&ndash;when did you learn that?&rdquo; he asked, astounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning. My housekeeper in Shadow Hill
telephoned me that Mr. Pawling had killed himself, that
the bank was closed, and that probably there was nothing
left for those who had funds deposited there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew that this morning?&rdquo; he asked, amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&ndash;&ndash;you still had courage to go to your Red
Cross, to your canteen and Hostess House&ndash;&ndash;to that
horrible Red Flag Club&ndash;&ndash;and face those beasts and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
make the&ndash;&ndash;the perfectly magnificent speech you
made!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&ndash;&ndash;did <i>you</i> hear it!&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments she sat motionless and very white
in her knowledge that this man had heard her confess
her own conversion.</p>
<p>Her brain whirled: she was striving to think steadily
trying to find the right way to reassure him&ndash;&ndash;to forestall
any impulsive chivalry born of imaginary obligation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she said in a colorless voice, &ldquo;there are so
many worse things than losing money. I think Mr.
Pawling&rsquo;s suicide shocked me much more than the knowledge
that I should be obliged to earn my own living
like millions of other women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it scared me for a few minutes. I couldn&rsquo;t
help that. But after I got over the first unpleasant&ndash;&ndash;feeling,
I concluded to go about my business in life
until it came time for me to adjust myself to the scheme
of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled without effort: &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s not really
so bad. I have a house in Shadow Hill to which I can
retreat when I sell this one; and with a tiny income from
the sale of this house, and with what I can earn, I
ought to be able to support myself very nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&ndash;&ndash;expect to sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must. Even if I sell my house and land in
Connecticut I cannot afford this house any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled, keeping her head and her courage high
without apparent effort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another job for you,&rdquo; she said lightly. &ldquo;Will
you be kind enough to put this house on your list?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jim, I do indeed. And the sooner you
can sell it for me the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;And the sooner you marry me the better,
Palla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she flushed crimson and made a quick gesture
as though to check him; but he went on: &ldquo;I heard what
you said to those filthy swine to-night. It was the
pluckiest, most splendid thing I ever heard and saw.
And I have seen battles. Some. But I never before
saw a woman take her life in her hands and go all alone
into a cage of the same dangerous, rabid beasts that
had slain a friend of hers within the week, and find
courage to face them and tell them they <i>were</i> beasts!&ndash;&ndash;and
more than that!&ndash;&ndash;find courage to confess her
own mistakes&ndash;&ndash;humble herself&ndash;&ndash;acknowledge what she
had abjured&ndash;&ndash;bear witness to the God whom once she
believed abandoned her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She strove to open her lips in protest&ndash;&ndash;lifted
her disconcerted eyes to his&ndash;&ndash;shrank away a little as
his hand fell over hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never faltered,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It damned near
killed me.... But I&rsquo;d have gone on loving you,
Palla, all my life. There never could have been anybody
except you. There was never anybody before
you. Usually there has been in a man&rsquo;s life. There
never was in mine. There never will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His firm hand closed on hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m such an ordinary, every day sort of fellow,&rdquo; he
said wistfully, &ldquo;that, after I began to realise how wonderful
you are, I&rsquo;ve been terribly afraid I wasn&rsquo;t up to
you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if I have cursed out your theories and creeds,
it almost seemed impertinent for me to do it, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
you really have so many talents and accomplishments,
so much knowledge, so infinite a capacity for things of
the mind, which are rather out of my mental sphere.
And I&rsquo;ve wondered sometimes, even if you ever consented
to marry me, whether such a girl as you are could jog
along with a business man who likes the arts but doesn&rsquo;t
understand them very well and who likes some of his
fellow men but not all of them and whose instinct is
to punch law-breakers in the nose and not weep over
them and lead them to the nearest bar and say, &lsquo;Go to
it, erring brother!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all the while he had been drawing her nearer as
he was speaking. And she was in his arms now, laughing
a little, crying a little, her flushed face hidden on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>He drew a deep breath and, holding her imprisoned,
looked down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, do you want me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, darling, but not this minute, because a clergyman
must come first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was cruel of him, as well as vigorously indelicate.
Her hot blush should have shamed him; her conversion
should have sheltered her.</p>
<p>But the man had had a hard time, and the bitterness
was but just going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me, Palla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long while her stifled whisper came: &ldquo;You
are brutal. Do you think I would do anything else&ndash;&ndash;now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And you never would have either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lying there close in his arms, she wondered. And,
still wondering, she lifted her head and looked up into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
his eyes&ndash;&ndash;watching them as they neared her own&ndash;&ndash;still
trying to see them as his lips touched hers.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He was the sort of man who got hungry when left
too long unfed. It was one o&rsquo;clock. They had gone
out to the refrigerator together, his arm around her
supple waist, her charming head against his shoulder&ndash;&ndash;both
hungry but sentimental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you really think,&rdquo; she said for the hundredth
time, &ldquo;that we ought to sell this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, darling. We&rsquo;ll run it if we have to
live on cereal and do our own laundry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;ll have to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help after business hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wonderful boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed to be some delectable things in the
ice chest.</p>
<p>They sat side by side on the kitchen table, blissfully
nourishing each other. Birds do it. Love-smitten
youth does it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you had the nerve to face
those beasts and tell them what you thought of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; she remonstrated, placing an olive between
his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have the Croix de Guerre,&rdquo; he said indistinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I aspire to is a very plain gold ring,&rdquo; she said,
smiling at him sideways.</p>
<p>And she slipped her hand into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Are</i> you going back into the army, Jim?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I heard it repeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Unless&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; His eyes narrowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
and he sat swinging his legs with an absent air and
puckered brows.</p>
<p>And after a while the same aloof look came into her
brown eyes, and she swung her slim feet absently.</p>
<p>Perhaps their remote gaze was fixed on visions of
a nearing future, brilliant with happiness, gay with
children&rsquo;s voices; perhaps they saw farther than that,
where the light grew sombre and where a shadowed sky
lowered above a blood-red flood, rising imperceptibly,
yet ever rising&ndash;&ndash;a stealthy, crawling crimson tide
spreading westward across the world.</p>
